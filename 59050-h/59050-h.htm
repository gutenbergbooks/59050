<p>It requires some assurance to step out of the
conventional in story writing. Especially does
it require courage on the part of one whose
ideals of what a story should be are far beyond
what his productions can ever attain. But
the physician, who gets closer to things human
than others do, may perhaps be forgiven
unorthodox subjects and methods of expression.
Surely, also, he will be excused for drawing
upon his own field of work for his subject
matter.</p>

<p>I have this to say of my material characters—they
are all taken from life. Even Tommy
the Outcast was the genuine article of hero.
He crept into my life through a hole in my
cellar window one furiously stormy night.
He went out of it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">via</i> a dose of poison, meant
for his hereditary foes—the rats. Talk? No,
he did not talk, but I’m sure he used to think—hard
and often—and I fancy no one will upbraid
me for trying in my feeble way to read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
his mind and act as his proxy in the expression
of the things he thought, and in telling the
sad story of his life.</p>

<p>The mythical red hero and the golden haired
goddess of the Yosemite are the more beautiful
for being unsubstantial. The pretty little legend
on which their story was founded was anonymously
published nearly fifty years ago in
some eastern magazine, the name of which
escapes me. I found it among the rubbish
of my grandfather’s attic, when a lad. It seems
that the legend was originally obtained from
an old Indian warrior, who related it essentially
as it had descended to him through many
generations of ancestors. Like many other
beautiful traditions of our American aborigines,
the legend of the Yosemite has been buried in
the mists of obscurity and the dust of forgetfulness.
I trust that my amplified version is
not unworthy of the original. It will at least
serve to resurrect from the Valley of the Lost
a bit of beautiful sentiment that deserved a
better fate. I hope this may not be its second
burial, and that the paleface may find something
sweetly sentimental in the mythical tale
of Tis-sa-ack and Tu-toch-a-nu-lah. For the
benefit of those who may chance to discern in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
the hero of the Yosemite a slight tinge of Frederick
Cozzens’ ancient legend of the Palisades,
I freely acknowledge the debt I owe to the “Big
Pappoose.”</p>

<p>Most of the incidents related in the various
stories in this volume are authentic. Those
upon which the story of the Dead Ideal is
founded come back to me vividly from my
student days with all the halo of bright romance
which they then possessed. To this day I have
longed to know who and what the beautiful
subject was. He who could not weave romance
about that fair unfortunate must needs be the
victim of that worst of fates—soul death.</p>

<p>Nearly all the characters in Poker Jim are
real. There was no dearth of material from
which to select subjects. I was born amid the
California Sierras in the placer mines of Tuolumne.
Some of the years of my early childhood
were spent in the mountains of Calaveras.
Here in the midst of a rude mining population
were to be found interesting characters a
plenty.</p>

<p>A few—alas! how very few—of those rugged,
homely, adventurous spirits whom I knew in
my boyhood are still living. I have within
a few months past been privileged to clasp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
their dear old hands and listen to their oft
told tales of the romantic early days of my
native state.</p>

<p>I recently spent several hours at the house
of a friend in San Francisco, watching the play
of emotion on the wrinkled face of an aged Argonaut
as he listened while our host and I were
discussing the various characters of the story
of Poker Jim. Needless to say, old time memories
were revived in the mind of the poor old
man. I shall never forget his tear dimmed
eyes as he looked up at me and said, reverently,
“Doc, I knowed ’em well—your pa, an’ your
gran’pa, an’ Poker Jim an’ all on ’em.”</p>

<p>As I sit here in my quiet study harking
back to my last trip to the mountains and
valleys of Tuolumne and Calaveras, there appears
before my mind’s eye a picture of the
old golden days brought down to the year 1900.
In the foreground, at the door of his rude log
cabin, stands that dear old octogenarian,
“French Tom” of Tuolumne, gazing toward
the green verdured hills on the opposite bank
of the river, just where Moccasin Creek debouches
into the swift running crystal waters
of the Tuolumne. He shades his poor old
eyes with his hand, and looks long and earn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>estly
at a man who is slowly passing along the
old Yosemite trail. When he reached the
summit of the hill the man turned and stood
limned against the brilliant morning sky, a
ghost of happier days.</p>

<p>Long past three score and ten, bent and
withered, crippled with the “rheumatiz,” with
pick on shoulder and pan and grub wallet
by his side, “Dixie” was still pursuing the Golden
Fleece. On the morrow—Sunday—Tom and
Dixie would meet and talk it all over, and tell
each other the same old wonderful lies of
enormous golden finds, and “saltings” of the
tenderfoot, that they had been exchanging
since ’49.</p>

<p>“Good luck, old pard!” and “The same to
you!” were wafted gently down the beautiful
valley to the heart-full wanderer who had
come home after so many years.</p>

<p>Dixie vanished over the brow of the hill,
and Tom dove into his tumble-down shack to
prepare the breakfast of fish fresh from the
river to which he had invited his doctor friend.</p>

<p>And the picture that my memory paints is
no longer possible, for dear old Dixie has gone
over the Divide, to dig for gold at the foot of
eternal rainbows in the placers of the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
Beyond. And I am glad that I went in quest of
childhood’s memories while it was yet time.</p>

<p>Out of the Valley of Shadows, Mnemosyne—most
puissant goddess of them all—leads forth
a procession of misty familiar shapes that bring
the warmth of affection to my heart and the
smile of welcome to my lips. And they smile
back at me in that quiet way which friendly
shadows have.</p>

<p>As the vague and unsubstantial forms flit
silently past me from out the ivory portals
where Memory’s golden scepter holds undisputed
sway, I recognize a host of my boyhood’s
friends; “Poker Jim”, “Boston”, “Toppy,”
“Big” Brown, “Yankee”, “Jersey”, “Link”
Spears, Tom Chandler, Dave Smuggins, Ike
Dessler, Bill Loveless, and many more of the
bronzed, deep-chested, red-shirted, hair-triggered
Knights of the Golden Fleece smile back
at me from the ghostly file.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, comes my boyhood’s
hero, that Turpin of the border, “Three Fingered
Jack” of Calaveras, who has been served
up to us in so many and various forms of
literary hash that I shall one day write his true
history as a matter of pious duty.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1860, that the faculty
of the University of Pennsylvania concluded to
confer the degree of Doctor of Medicine upon
your humble servant. Whether the faculty of
that now famous school allowed me to graduate
on the principle that actuated the performers in
a western band, who implored their audiences
not to shoot, as they were doing the best they
could, I cannot say, but graduate I did, and
as with all other students of medicine, it was
then that my troubles began. I was not long
in discovering that the piece of crisp parchment
which the members of the faculty had endorsed
as showing the scientific qualifications of William
Weymouth, M. D. and which entitled him to
practice medicine, was no open sesame to fame
and prosperity.</p>

<p>My parents were at that time living in
Kentucky, in a small town that offered little
encouragement to a young man beginning practice.
The confidence of one’s old neighbors
is of even slower growth than the beard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
which the young doctor yearns, as a badge of
wisdom and learning that he who runs may
read.</p>

<p>The country in which I spent my boyhood—I
was born in the state of Maine—was even less
inviting than the state of my adoption. It is
possible that I entertained a little of my mother’s
prejudice against Yankeedom in those days.
She was a native of Kentucky, and had never
become thoroughly reconciled to the country
to which my father had taken her soon after her
marriage. It was in acquiescence to her homesick
pleadings that my father finally moved to
Kentucky, and settled in the little town
wherein my parents lived for the rest of their
days in such happiness as people of modest
means can secure only among the warm hearted,
generous people south of Mason and Dixon’s
line.</p>

<p>Had my home surroundings offered any
inducements to the professional career I had
planned for myself, I should certainly have
returned home to practice. My parents were
living alone, and my natural impulse was to
return to them and do the best I could at
practice, as long as they should live. It was
with some twinges of conscience, therefore, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
I finally decided against going back to Kentucky
to locate.</p>

<p>There were but three of us children, a brother,
younger than myself, and a sister, two years
older. My sister had married a gentleman from
Memphis, and had long since gone to that city
to live. My young brother had left home some
years before I graduated, and no one knew what
had become of him, much to my regret and to
the sorrow of his parents, whose favorite, I must
admit, the boy had ever been.</p>

<p>Jim had always been a wild lad, and was
stamped as an incorrigible almost as soon as he
could toddle alone. It was said that a little
of the old strain of Indian blood, with which
tradition had endowed our family, had cropped
out in him. He was one of those rollicking,
handsome dare-devils; that everybody fears
and loves at the same moment. The very sight
of Jim’s curly, black head and mischievous eyes
struck the good neighbors with terror. Trouble
was expected from the moment that boy put
in an appearance—and the good folks were
seldom disappointed. Sometimes they would
acknowledge that “it might have been worse,”
but such occasions were rare.</p>

<p>But all who knew the curly headed little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
rascal admitted that he possessed two excellent
qualities; he was as brave as a lion, and kind-hearted
to a fault. He would fight at “the drop
of the hat,” and no boy ever heard him cry
quits. He was as ready to split a cord of wood
for a poor widow, as he was to tie a tin can to her
house-dog’s tail, and that’s saying a great deal.</p>

<p>As the boy grew toward manhood, he fell in
with evil associates, and as is always the case
with boys of his peculiar disposition, he became
thoroughly demoralized. Cards, whisky, horses
and women—these were the unsubstantial foundation
upon which rested the new world that
his vicious companions opened up to him.</p>

<p>While living at the old home in Kentucky, I
had always had a great controlling influence over
little Jim, and even after I left home for college,
I maintained a certain degree of influence over
him. Gradually, however, our correspondence
became infrequent, until we heard from each
other only at very long intervals.</p>

<p>Knowing how much I thought of the lad, my
parents never alluded to Jim’s discrepancies in
their letters to me. I have sometimes thought
that possibly they were actuated to a certain
degree by false pride; they did not care to expose
the failings of their idol to his natural rival in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
their affections—his brother. Whatever the
explanation of the reticence of my parents may
have been, I had no intimation of the true state
of affairs until after the poor boy had fled from
home, never to return.</p>

<p>It was the old story; a woman, a rival, a
quarrel—ostensibly the outcome of a game of
cards—the lie, a shot, and my young brother a
fugitive. What a monotonous sameness there
is in all such stories, to be sure. No one has
invented a single new character or a single new
situation in the play of passion, through all the
ages. What new phases have the romanticists
of the world added to human hopes, fears, sentiments,
passions and vices in all the centuries?
None—and yet the world demands originality
of its authors!</p>

<p>It will be seen that I was between two fires,
in deciding on my course after graduation—a
sense of filial duty to my sorrowing and lonely
parents, and a new-born professional ambition.
As is usually the case, ambition conquered, and
I decided to seek my fortune in new fields, far
away from the paternal roof. California was,
at that time, by no means a new sensation, but
the novelty of the gold craze had not yet worn
off. I had no particular ambition to seek my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
fortune in foreign lands, and as the Pacific
coast was to ambitious Americans still the El
Dorado of all youthful dreams, I very naturally
turned my thoughts in that direction. I was
not long in coming to a decision, and after writing
my plans to my parents, I made my arrangements
to depart for San Francisco.</p>

<p>The choice of routes to California was a very
simple matter, for one who was within easy
access of the Atlantic sea board. There was no
railroad communication with the Pacific coast
in those days, hence I was compelled to select
from the several ocean routes that which
promised to consume the least time. With this
idea I embarked at New York City for San
Francisco, on a steamer of the Panama line, and,
after a pleasant and uneventful voyage, arrived
in San Francisco, the portals of promise through
which so many hopeful Jasons had passed before
me in search of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The San Francisco gambling house was the
common ground upon which the flotsam and
jetsam of the early cosmopolitan population
of the city met. The proprietors of the gambling
hells certainly knew human nature thoroughly,
judging by the variety of excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
which they provided. Every known game and
every variety of liquor distinguished for its
vital-reaching propensities, was at the disposal
of their patrons, day and night. The boast
of the gambling house keeper was, that he had
thrown away his front door key the day the
house was opened.</p>

<p>When the gambling fever struck the good citizen
or unwary visitor from the mines, he could
have his choice of a variety of remedies; monte,
faro, roulette, poker—anything he pleased,
providing he had his “dust” with him.</p>

<p>And do not imagine that the proprietors and
dealers of the games were low-browed, ugly
ruffians. Smooth, sleek and handsome were the
nimble fingered gentry who attended to the
wants of the fever-stricken fools who had more
ounces in their pockets than in their brain-pans—until
the fever was cured, when the loss of
balance was in the other direction. Many a
college education was wasted—or utilized, if
you please—on the dealer’s side of a “sweat-cloth”
in some of those dens. My fine gentleman
would not swing a pick—unless it were an
ivory one with which he could take away a
sturdy miner’s golden ounces much more quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
than the hapless fool had dug them with the
implements of honest toil.</p>

<p>But the scene was an alluring one, nevertheless.
The rattle of chips and dice; the ringing
of silver and the clink of gold; the thud of the
buckskin bags of gold dust as they were recklessly
thrown upon the table; the duller, yet
more portentous, shuffling of the cards; the whir
of the wheel where <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rouge et noir</i> was being
played, were entertaining to my ear, untrained
as it was to such sounds.</p>

<p>“Come up and make your bets, gentlemen!
The game is made! Five — eleven — eighteen — twenty — twenty-two — twenty-four — twenty-eight — thirty-one.
Red wins!”—and the never
ending procession of excited fools stepped up to
diversion and disaster.</p>

<p>There was one thing the proprietors of those
gambling houses forgot—they should have had
a suicide room and an undertaking department.
It would have saved the city fathers a deal of
trouble in the disposal of the large crop of
unknown remains that the morning light disclosed
in obscure corners of the city—poor
fugitives from self; victims of dens where Venus,
Momus, Terpsichore and Bacchus grovelled in
the dirt yet held undisputed sway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
There was a grim irony, and yet, withal, a
tinge of comedy, in the farewell treat of fiery
liquor with which the management bowed out
its ruined guests—bowed them out of the den of
iniquity and into a slough of despond from which
they oft-times never emerged—on this side of
eternity.</p>

<p>I was standing one evening in “The Palace”—a
gambling den with the usual appurtenances
of tributary and dependent vice—curiously
watching the movements of the dealer at one
of the numerous faro games. Every table was
crowded with players and surrounded by
spectators, some of whom, like myself, were
mere curiosity seekers, but most of them being
devotees of the shrine of the goddess, Chance,
who were impatiently awaiting the occurrence
of a vacancy at the table—when a bankrupt
player should make way for fatter victims.</p>

<p>Sitting just opposite the dealer was a young
lad, who could not have been more than seventeen
years of age, betting away with a recklessness
that would have done credit to a millionaire.
The youngster was evidently flushed
with liquor and laboring under the highest degree
of excitement.</p>

<p>Standing just behind the boy, was a woman—evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the under world—who, it was
easy to see, was influencing his betting. Whether
this creature was giving direct advice and
encouragement or not, I cannot say, but the lad
was certainly trying to appear as brave and recklessly
extravagant as possible, for the apparent
purpose of impressing the woman. The furtive
glance which the dealer exchanged with his
charming “capper” now and then, was sufficient
to enable even one of my limited experience, to
form a correct conclusion as to the status of
affairs.</p>

<p>Just opposite me and almost directly behind
the dealer, stood a man who, I was certain, had
been studying my face from time to time ever
since I had taken my place among the spectators
of the game. A stealthy glance at my
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis à vis</i> when he happened to be watching the
boy’s playing—which seemed to be dividing
his attention with myself—revealed a person
of most striking appearance and unique individuality.</p>

<p>Apparently about twenty-five years of age,
judging by his heavy black moustache and
mature development; a tall, athletic figure;
long curling locks of jet black hair hanging
loosely down over his shoulders; eyes as black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
as sloes and as piercing as those of a hawk—the
stranger was indeed a handsome and most
picturesque character. His closely buttoned
coat of fashionable cut, small, neat boots, and
surmounting all, his broad-brimmed hat, made
him even more striking, if possible. I glanced at
his hands and noted that they were well formed,
and of a color that indicated bath gentility
and a life in which manual labor bore no part.</p>

<p>As I stole a second glance at the handsome
stranger, our eyes met, and I fancied that he
started slightly. He glanced away quickly,
but as the boy in whom he appeared to take
such an interest was apparently getting pretty
near the end of his funds, I concluded that the
unknown’s emotion—if indeed he had really
displayed any—was due to the evident bad
luck of his unconscious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protegé</i>. It was plain
to me that he was interested in the boy, for there
was an expression about the corners of his
mouth, and an almost tender gleam in his eyes,
that could not be mistaken by any one who possessed
even a fair ability in character reading.</p>

<p>I knew not why the picturesque stranger
interested me, but there seemed to be some
indefinable attraction about him, which caused
me to forget the game and watch him as closely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
as I could without risk of giving offense. As
our eyes met, I experienced a peculiar sense of
mutual recognition, and yet it was seemingly
impossible, or at least, highly improbable, that
we had ever met before.</p>

<p>But the occurrences of the next few minutes
entirely diverted my mind for the time being
from the question of recognition.</p>

<p>The poor, foolish boy soon exhausted his
money, and vacated his place at the unholy
altar. I saw him whisper to the female, in
whose company he evidently was, and apparently
request her to step aside with him. She
did so, and they stood for some time in earnest,
confidential discussion of a subject which their
gestures made all too apparent. The bird was
plucked, his charms were gone, and he was not
only refused a “stake” wherewith to possibly
retrieve his losses, but the light of his first
romance was extinguished forever—or until he
had procured more money, which, to the
woman’s mind, probably amounted to the
same thing.</p>

<p>The expression on that poor boy’s face was
a horror and a sermon both in one. As the
woman coldly and haughtily swept away from
him, her tainted skirts swishing suggestively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and ominously over the floor, gathering up
tobacco and other filth which was purity itself
beside her harpy-like soul, the lad stood gazing
after her as if in a dream. He was stunned
into obliviousness to everything but the realization
of his disaster.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment as though incapable
of motion, then with an expression of
desperation in his eyes, and a countenance
that was the typification of utterly hopeless
despair, he passed through the green baize
doors out into the night—his first black night
of fathomless woe and absolute demoralization.</p>

<p>I had watched the boy from the time we
left the table, and his expression, as the hawk
that had plucked away his youthful plumage
flew away from her victim, at once appealed to
my young professional eye. I made my diagnosis
almost intuitively, and instinctively started
to follow the lad, as quickly as I could without
attracting his attention. As I turned
toward the exit, I caught a glimpse of some one
just passing out. As the doors swung back before
him, I recognized the stalwart form of
the picturesque unknown.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief, and strolled leisurely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
along after the stranger. I do not know
why, but I felt that the boy was safe. I was
sure I could not be mistaken in my interpretation
of the play of emotions that had animated
the stranger’s face, as he watched the game
which had ruined the poor lad whom he was
evidently following.</p>

<p>I soon saw that I was right. The stranger
caught up with the boy just as he stepped into
the brilliant light that illuminated the sidewalk
in front of the gambling den. Placing one
hand upon the boy’s shoulder, he gently but
firmly halted him, I meanwhile drawing back
into the shadow of the outer door of the Palace,
determined, with the best of motives, to see
the thing through.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, my lad,” said the man,
“I just want to say a word to you, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The boy looked at him as though dazed for
a moment, and then replied slowly:</p>

<p>“I’m not frightened, sir. You’re not apt to
do anything worse to me than I’ve already done
to myself. My money is all gone, and you can’t
do any more than kill me, if you don’t want
money. As for killing me,—well, I have more
lead than gold left, and I’ve not forgotten how
my father taught me to die, like a gentleman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
I fancied that the boy looked quite the hero
as he spoke. There was a little touch of the
southron born about him that brought my
Kentucky home back to me. I had seen such
boys there, and I knew—well, there was one
who was something like that, whom I would
have given the world to see, and my heart went
out to that poor, unfortunate lad. And, yet,
for some reason, I had an even kinder feeling
for the man who was evidently going to act
the friend and adviser of our mutual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protegé</i>.</p>

<p>“Pardon me for even suggesting that you
might be frightened,” said the unknown, “but
you are young; San Francisco has some queer
ways and still queerer people, and it’s not
every man who gets the drop on you who means
well. I am free to say that I should be uneasy
myself, were I to be similarly accosted, and
they say I am—well, that I’m ‘no chicken’,
you know. Where are you from, my boy?”</p>

<p>“I’m from Virginia, sir,” replied the boy,
straightening up with a little of the Old Dominion
pride, I thought.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed his new-found friend, “I
was sure I detected a little of the old cavalier
strain in your face. What is your name, may
I ask?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
“Gordon Cabell, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, Master Cabell, I know your breed
pretty well; I’m from—well, I’ve met southern
boys before. Now, I’m going to talk plainly
to you, and you mustn’t be offended. I’m
going to be your friend, for to-night, at least,
and you must listen to me.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to give you a moral lecture
on gambling or liquor drinking. I presume that
the Gordons, Cabells, and many more of your
ancestors, have played cards, drunk whisky,
raced horses, attended cock fights, and fought
duels, and have done many other things that
people with colder blood object to, but they did
all these things like gentlemen, I’ll warrant
you. Now, tell me, young fellow, did you ever
know of a Cabell doing what you have done,
and still worse, what you were going to do
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Sir!” said the boy indignantly, reaching
toward his pistol, “I will—”</p>

<p>“Oh, no you won’t, Master Cabell. Look me
in the eye, please!” and the boy gazed at the
stranger wonderingly, as he drew his tall form
up to its full height, calmly folded his arms, and
looked down upon him.</p>

<p>“I have already told you that I am your friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Gordon, and the Cabells do not make targets
of their friends. Give me your pistol, sir!”</p>

<p>The boy almost mechanically drew his pistol
from the holster beneath his loose-fitting coat,
and obeying the mandate of a will more powerful
than his own, handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Gordon,” said the stranger,
“I’ll return it to you presently.</p>

<p>“Now, my boy, let us get to business. You
have fallen among thieves, and have been
plucked, like the unsuspecting, foolish pigeon
that you are. I don’t want to know your
past history; life is too short, but I do want
a hand in your future.</p>

<p>“You are the scion of aristocratic stock.
Your ancestors before you were worshippers
at the shrine of beauty, but it was the beauty
of purity and virtue. You have been dragging
your family pride down into the dirt, and offering
up your young soul upon an altar which
a true son of the Old Dominion should loathe.
You have squandered your money trying to
beat a game that’s a ‘dead-open-and-shut’
against you. You are listening to one who
knows whereof he speaks, I assure you, my boy.</p>

<p>“Not satisfied with what you had already
done, which after all is easily remedied, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
were about to stain your family name and
record with a crime that nothing on earth
could ever wipe out. You were about to kill—a
fool, Gordon, who may yet be made a wise
man.</p>

<p>“I once knew a boy who played the fool—much
as you have done—and who is still expiating
his folly. He might eventually have
done as you were about to do, only he happened
to be compelled to—well, he didn’t shoot himself,
that’s one thing to his credit, although his
family, and not himself, was perhaps the gainer
by it, or will be sometime, if the truth is
ever known. He couldn’t avoid the other—there
was nothing about that of which he had
cause to be ashamed, although the world, that
knows not the circumstances, thinks differently.</p>

<p>“Now, Gordon, I’m going to stake you.
Don’t say no—it is a loan if you please, or anything
you choose to call it. Take this, and get
out of this hell-hole of a town as quick as the
Lord will let you.”</p>

<p>The boy stood for a moment with the
tears streaming down his cheeks, and then
hesitatingly took the proffered bag of dust.</p>

<p>“And you will really let me pay it back
to you, sir, when I am able?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
“I certainly will, if we ever meet again,”
replied the man. “As I have already told you,
my boy, I know your breed; it is not the kind
that likes to remain under obligations to one
who is an entire stranger. But, after all,
your honorable intention clears the obligation.</p>

<p>“And, Gordon, here’s your pistol. I think
it will be safer in your hands than it was a
short time ago. And now I am going to give
you a few parting words of advice.</p>

<p>“In the first place, young fellow, don’t gamble.
If your blood is too red to heed this admonition,
learn to play poker. It’s a scientific
game and a square one, usually—always so
among gentlemen. Never bet against another
man’s game, nor play against a percentage.
Gambling games of that kind are like the
play of life, the percentage is in favor of the
dealer, and it fetches you sooner or later.</p>

<p>“In the second place, young man, set up a
shrine in your heart, and worship female purity
and virtue; then you are safe. If you have a
mother or sisters, don’t forget that a woman
who is not fit for their society is not worthy of
your regard.</p>

<p>“Youthful affection, my boy, is not inexhaustible.
Keep it for future reference—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
worthy objects. You may yet live to wish
that the worldly heart of to-morrow were the
young and fresh one of yesterday.</p>

<p>“And now, I must leave you. Good-night,
my boy, and don’t forget what I have said to
you.”</p>

<p>“But, sir,” cried the lad, “your name, who
shall I—?”</p>

<p>His benefactor had disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>The boy stood for a time gazing blankly
into the night in the direction in which the
stranger had disappeared; then, drawing
himself up proudly, as became a son of fair
Virginia, he placed the bag of gold in his pocket
and his pistol in its holster, cast a scornful
glance toward the windows of the Palace and
strode resolutely away.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A few days after the scene at the gaming
house, I chanced to meet an old time friend
of my father’s, hailing from Maine. Mr. Allen,
it seemed, had “struck it rich” and was on his
way back to the “States.” From this gentleman
I received a glowing account of the wealth
of the placer mining region in Tuolumne county,
which at once determined my future course.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
When he informed me that the country where
he had made his “pile” was not only rich in
gold, but badly in need of doctors, I decided
that Tuolumne should have at least one medical
celebrity.</p>

<p>Investing some of my greatly diminished
capital in an outfit which I thought might harmonize
to a certain extent with the new field
for which I was about to depart, I bade farewell
to San Francisco and set my face toward
the fame and the pot of gold that lay at the
foot of the rainbow of my dreams.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It was a calm sultry evening in the month
of July, 1860, that I embarked on board a
steamboat plying between San Francisco and
Stockton, the latter city being the gateway
to the wonderful country distinguished by its
wealth and scarcity of doctors, so graphically
described by my friend, Mr. Allen.</p>

<p>The trip up the Sacramento river, although
pleasant enough, had very little novelty about
it, and I confess that I at first experienced a
feeling of disappointment at the lack of entertainment
which the scenery afforded.</p>

<p>Our route lay for a comparatively short distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
up the Sacramento, the major portion of
my journey being comprised by one of its
tributaries—the San Joaquin—a stream that
is insignificant enough during the dry season,
but which in the early spring is formidable
enough to those who live sufficiently near the
river to get the benefit of its overflow during
the spring freshets.</p>

<p>The San Joaquin river is, without doubt, the
crookedest navigable stream in the world. There
was never a snake that could contort himself
into so fantastic an outline as presented by
that lazily meandering branch of the Sacramento.
So crooked is it, that one entertains a
constant dread of running ashore; the bank
is always dead ahead and unpleasantly near.</p>

<p>This serpentine river traverses a perfectly
level plain throughout the navigable part of
its course, its banks being flanked by tule beds
which extend farther than the eye can see. Indeed,
the valley of the San Joaquin is one vast
bed of tules, extending fully one hundred and
fifty miles. When, as sometimes happens during
the dry season, the tule beds take fire, the spectacle,
especially at night, is at once grand and
terribly impressive. I remember on one occasion
taking a night trip up the river during one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of these fires. The scene in the vicinity of
Monte Diablo, was one of the most majestic
and awe inspiring I have ever witnessed. The
name of “Devil’s Mountain” seemed singularly
appropriate.</p>

<p>It was nearly three in the morning when I
arrived at Stockton, and, as there was nothing
to be gained by going ashore, I remained on
board the boat, determined to get the full
benefit of a morning nap. It seemed to me that
I had just closed my eyes, when I was awakened
by the yelling of the roustabouts and stage
agents on the wharf. I had barely time to dress,
hustle ashore and hurriedly swallow a cup of
coffee, before my stage was ready to start, and
I was off for Jacksonville—the particular town
of Tuolumne county that I had determined to
favor with my medical skill and fortune-hunting
ambition.</p>

<p>There was nothing pleasant about that stage
ride—it was memorable only for its inconveniences
and its motley load pf passengers. A
hot, dusty, bumping journey in the old time
California stage makes pretty reading as Bret
Harte has described it but I am free to say that
the reality was not so enjoyable. The red dust
of the California stage road gets into a fellow’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
system so deeply that his ideas are likely to be
of a practical or even profane sort, even though
he be normally quite sentimental.</p>

<p>Picturesque, however, the ride certainly was.
Several red-shirted, rough-bearded miners, lent
just the right touch of local color, while the
imitation frontiersman—of whom I was the
type—was sufficiently well represented to afford
a suitable foil for the genuine article, as typified
by my brawny-chested, be-pistoled, unkempt
fellow passengers.</p>

<p>In one corner of the stage was a little chap
who was evidently what we would call a dude
nowadays. This young gentleman had done his
level best to put a bold front on matters, by
rigging himself out like a cowboy. The result
was somewhat ludicrous, as may be imagined.
Nor was the poor little idiot by any means unconscious
of his features of incongruity—he
realized most keenly the absurdity of his position
and the fact that he was being guyed. The
miners, however, seemed to enjoy the situation
immensely.</p>

<p>“Say, pardner,” said one tawny-bearded
giant, leaning toward the innocent, and startling
him so that his eye glasses nearly dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
off his nose—“Gimme a pull at yer pistol, wont
ye?”</p>

<p>“Ah, beg pawdon, sir, what did you say?”
stammered the dude.</p>

<p>“W’y I s’posed you could understan’ th’
English langwidge,” replied the miner, “but
seein’ ez how ye don’t, I’ll translate her to ye.
I asked ye ter give me a pull at yer whisky
bottle.”</p>

<p>“Ah, really,” said the innocent, “I’d be
chawmed, you know, doncher know, but I
don’t carry the article. In fact, sir, I nevah
drink.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t say so? Well, I want ter know!”
answered the miner. “Now, see hyar, sonny,
seein’ ez how you aint got no whisky, jest
gimme a chaw uv terbacker an’ we’ll call it
squar’.”</p>

<p>“I—aw—I’m sorry to say that I don’t use
tobacco, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sho! g’long, young feller! Is—that—so?
How the h—l d’ye keep a goin’? Whut d’ye do
fer excitement—p’raps ye plays poker, eh?”
said the stalwart son of the pick.</p>

<p>“Oh no!” exclaimed the tenderfoot in dismay,
“I nevah play cards!”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t tell me!” replied the miner. “Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
well, well! By the way, young feller; be keerful
not ter lose ’em—ye mout need ’em ter git
home with.”</p>

<p>“Need what, sir?” asked the victim.</p>

<p>“Yer wings!”—and the miners broke out in
a huge guffaw that bade fair to dislocate a
wheel of the stage, and impelled the driver to
look anxiously and inquiringly at his passengers.</p>

<p>The tenderfoot collapsed and remained in
a state of complete innocuousness until he
arrived at his destination, which, fortunately
for his sensitive organization, happened to be
the first town where we changed horses. As he
minced gingerly away toward the hotel, the
miners winked at each other most prodigiously.
Happening to catch the big fellow’s eye, by a
happy inspiration I was impelled to wink also.
This at once established me on a friendly footing
with my rough companions, and, as I
happened to have a bottle of fairly good liquor
with me, the rest of the way into the regard of
those simple miners was easily traversed.</p>

<p>During the conversation that naturally followed
the unconventional formation of our acquaintance,
the big-bearded fellow, who appeared
to be the leader of the little party of miners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
following the blunt fashion of the country,
suddenly remarked:</p>

<p>“By the way, stranger, whut might yer name
be, an’ whut part uv the diggin’s might yer be
headin’ fer?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I replied smilingly, “it is about time
we introduced ourselves, isn’t, it? My name is
William Weymouth, recently of Kentucky, a
doctor by profession, and bound for Jacksonville,
where I contemplate digging gold when
the weather will permit, and practicing medicine
when it will not.”</p>

<p>“A doctor, an’ bound fer Jacksonville, eh?
Well, Doc,” said my new acquaintance, reaching
out his grimy paw with a cordiality that
could not be mistaken, “I’m d—d glad ter know
ye! Jacksonville is our town, an’ a h—l uv a
good town she is at that, y’u bet! We’re jest
gittin’ back from Frisco, an’ doin’ it on tick, too.
We’ve been doin’ the sport racket down yonder,
an’ I reckon the sports hev done us, eh, pards?”
His “pards” having acquiesced, my brawny
friend cut off a huge chew of “nigger heel,”
stowed it away in his capacious cheek, and after
a few preliminary expectorations that resembled
geysers, continued:</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been fer ole Tom McDougal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
up thar on the box, we’d a took Walker’s line
back ter our claims”—and the big miner
glanced gratefully in the direction of the generous
Mr. McDougal.</p>

<p>“And now that I have found that you are
to be my fellow townsmen,” I said pleasantly,
“permit me to remind you that the introduction
has been one-sided. What are your names,
may I ask?”</p>

<p>The miner winked at his companions, laughed
a little deep down in his huge red beard, and
replied:</p>

<p>“D—d if I didn’t fergit that ther was two
sides to the interdoocin’ bizness. Ye see, stranger,
we aint payin’ much attention ter feller’s
handles in the mines. Most enny ole thing’ll
do fer a name. That’s why we sometimes
fergits our manners. This yere gang is purty
well supplied with names, but ye mightn’t hev
sich good luck ev’ry time, ’specially in Tuolumne
county, eh, pards?”</p>

<p>His “pards” having again nodded and winked
their approval, my brawny friend proceeded
with his introductions.</p>

<p>“I’m called in the diggin’s by sev’ral names
an’ y’u kin do like the rest uv my fren’s—take
yer pick. I’m mostly known as Big Brown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
tho’ some folks calls me Big Sandy. When
I was in the states, I b’lieve they used to call
me Daniel W. Brown, but I wouldn’t swar to it.
This feller nex’ ter me hyar, is the hon’able
Mr. Dixie,’ or Snub-nose Dixie fer short, who
aint never hed much ter say about his other
name, if he ever had enny, eh, Dixie? That
lantern-jawed cuss a settin’ long side uv y’u,
is Deacon Jersey, utherwise an’ more favor’bly
known ez Link Spears. We calls him Deacon,
cuz he never was inside of a church in his hull
life. He’s the only genooine deacon this side
of the Sierras. Thar aint none uv the hypercrit’
erbout him, neither, I kin tell ye. Ye’ll
find us fellers’ tastes kinder runs erlike, f’r
instance,”—and Big Brown looked longingly in
the direction of my “pistol” pocket.</p>

<p>“In the matter of thirst,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Right y’u air, Doc! I kin see yer goin ter
be a valooable addition to our diggin’s. We
need a doctor ez kin tell whut’s the matter
with a feller ’thout cuttin’ him wide open.
Ye see, we likes ter keep our own han’s in,
an’ don’t calkerlate ter leave much of the
cuttin’ ter the doctor—ennyhow, ’till we’ve
had our little innin’s, eh, boys?”</p>

<p>Once again the boys agreed, with, I thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
just a slight suspicion of gratified vanity in
their expressions.</p>

<p>It was a long weary way to Jacksonville,
but my time was well spent. Thanks to the
kindness and garrulity of my new-found yet
none the less sincere, friends, and the confidence
engendered by my rapidly diminishing
supply of stimulants, I found myself, by the
time I arrived at my destination, fairly well
acquainted with the town, its ways and its citizens.</p>

<p>Jacksonville, at the time I landed in the then
thriving place, was one of the most noted mining
centers in the placer country. Its location
was most picturesque. Nestled among the
foot-hills of the glorious Sierras on the banks
of the Tuolumne river, and peopled by as cosmopolitan
and heterogeneous a population as
was ever gathered within the confines of one
small town, my new home was attractive because
of its novelty, if nothing more.</p>

<p>Ages and ages of alternately falling and
receding waters, centuries of snow and enormous
rainfalls, had washed down from the
mountains into the valley of the Tuolumne,
those auriferous particles, the great abundance
of which had made Jacksonville spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
into busy life and thriving prosperity, almost
in a single day.</p>

<p>But the very elements which had laid the
alluring foundation of the valley’s wealth, were
even then conspiring to avenge the rifling of
the rich deposits of the valley by the irreverent
hands of the modern Argonauts.</p>

<p>The Tuolumne river was a variable stream.
During the dry season, it was but a thin, disjointed,
silvery ribbon, across which one could
walk dry-shod, in places. But in the early
spring, the little stream at which the wayfarer
was wont to laugh, and in whose bed the eager
miner delved with impunity and profit, took
revenge upon the disturbers of its ancient
course. It became a raging torrent, resistlessly
carrying all before it and sometimes severely
punishing for his temerity the unwary miner
who had pitched his tent or built his rude cabin
too near the river bank. But all the revenge
which the Tuolumne had taken in all the years
since the settlement of the valley, was as nothing
to that which was yet to come. That vale
of thrift, industry and smiling prosperity was
destined to become a valley of death, destruction,
desolation and ruin.</p>

<p>But were not Pompeii and Herculaneum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and in later days, our own San Francisco,
joyful and unsuspecting to the last? And
why should the people of Tuolumne dread a
danger of which familiarity and fancied security
had made them forgetful, or possibly
even contemptuous. The average citizen of
Jacksonville could calmly face death in a material
form, and why should he concern himself
with that which passed by upon the other
side with each succeeding spring?</p>

<p>By no means the least attractive feature
of Jacksonville was the rugged self-confidence
and honesty of the majority of its people. Even
the Chinese, who composed a large part of the
population, seemed to be a better variety of
the almond-eyed heathen than I had supposed
could possibly exist. The hair-triggered sensibility
and powder-and-ball ethics of the dominant
race seemed to be most effective civilizers.</p>

<p>I am far from claiming that Jacksonville
presented an ideal state of civilization, but
this I do say, in justice to my old town; life
and property were safer there than they are
to-day in many more pretentious communities,
that claim to rank as centers from which civilization
radiates like the rays of a star. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
sense of personal responsibility made the French
the politest nation on the face of the earth;
it was the foundation upon which the spirit
of the “Old South” was builded firmer than
a rock; it was the soul that beat back the
furious waves of shot and shell that so often
hailed upon the southern chivalry on many
a hard fought field. A similar spirit of self-assertion
and personal responsibility pervaded
the Tuolumne valley, and raised its average
moral standard to a height far beyond that of
many a metropolis of a more vicious and effete
civilization.</p>

<p>Warm-hearted, impulsive, honest, courageous,
fiery-tempered, quick-triggered Argonauts of the
Tuolumne valley—a health to those of you who
still live, and peace to those who have laid
down the pick and pan forever and have inspected
their sluice-boxes for the last time!
When the final “clean-up” comes, may the
“find” be full of nuggets—“sixteen dollars to
the ounce.”</p>

<p>There was no better opportunity of becoming
intimately acquainted with the town of
Jacksonville, its people and its customs, than
was afforded by the Tuolumne House, where I
made my headquarters. There may be better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
hotels in the world than that primitive one,
but it had outgrown its canvas period and had
become a pretentious frame structure, and this
fact alone made it famous. It had no rival, for
the old “Empire,” so long presided over by
that honest, sturdy old Scot, Rob McCoun, had
long since been converted into a Chinese
grocery, while its erstwhile owner had been dead
for several years. As for the only other hotel,
McGinnis, its proprietor, had never been in the
race since his cook, one unlucky day, brewed
the coffee and tea simultaneously in the same
pot. The hundred and seventy-odd boarders
who fed at McGinnis’ “festive” rack were not to
be consoled—they “quit him cold” and went over
to the enemy. Tradition says that “Mac.”
half killed the luckless cook, one Mike Corcoran,
“Fer puttin’ coffee in the tay pot, ther d—d
scoundrel!” but the boarders were not to be
placated.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> My fellow citizens of Jacksonville
were very particular, and quite sensitive, with
respect to the quality and quantity of liquids
that entered their stomachs.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> Axin’ Mr. McGinnis’ pardon—if he be still living.—Author.</p></div>

<p>The material comforts of the Tuolumne
House aside, there was never a cheerier, heartier,
pluckier boniface than George Keyse. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
was to the manner born, and could take a gun
or a knife away from an excited boarder quite
as gracefully and quickly as he could, if necessary,
turn his own flapjacks.</p>

<p>Mr. Keyse had an invaluable assistant in
one Dave Smuggins, who officiated alternately
as barkeeper, porter and hotel clerk. Smuggins
was a well-bred man, and, it was said, was
originally educated for the ministry. The only
evidence at hand, however, was certain oratorical
propensities that overcame him and made
him forget his real position when he awakened
the boarders early o’ mornings. I can hear him
now, as he stood at the top of the stairway,
yelling in stentorian tones—“Arouse all ye
sleepers, an’ listen to the purty little airly
birds singin’ praises tew the Lord! D—n yer
bloody eyes! Git up!” saying which the modern
psalmist discreetly went below and took his
position behind the bar, ready to dispense
“eye-openers” to the early caller.</p>

<p>Jacksonville proved to be not only a pleasant
place of residence but an excellent field for my
professional work. The climate was almost germ-proof,
and it was a real pleasure to practice the
semi-military surgery characteristic of my field
of labor. Primary union was my speciality in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
those days, and I used to get results the memory
of which sometimes makes me blush for
those I occasionally get with our modern aseptic
and antiseptic methods. No matter how
much my patients might shoot or carve each
other, any fellow who had life enough left in
him to crawl or be carried off the field of battle,
usually got well.</p>

<p>Beyond accompanying an occasional prospecting
party, largely for recreation but partly in
my professional capacity, I did but little in the
way of mining. My practice gave me plenty to
do, and was lucrative enough as practices go, so
I soon settled down to as routine a life as my
curious and lively surroundings would permit.</p>

<p>I was sitting in that portion of the Tuolumne
House yclept by courtesy “the office,” quite late
one evening, listening to the quaint talk of
my miner friends and marvelling on the quantity
of fluid the human body could lose by way
of expectoration and still live, when I was recalled
to a realization of the fact that I was a
practitioner of medicine, by a voice at the
hotel door.</p>

<p>“Say, Doc, kin I see y’u a minute?”</p>

<p>Looking up I saw standing in the doorway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
one of the boys, who was familiarly known as
Toppy, his States’ name being Ike Dexter.
Toppy motioned for me to come out on the
porch, and impressed by his gravity of manner
and earnestness of gesticulation, I hastened to
comply.</p>

<p>“What is it, Toppy?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “thar’s one uv my friends
whut’s bin an’ got hisself hurt, an’ I want y’u
ter come an’ fix him up. He’s a very parti’cler
friend, an’ I’d like ter hev yer do yer best on
him. Ye needn’t say nuthin’ ter the boys
about it, jes’ now, Doc.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Toppy, I’ll go with you, but
what kind of an accident has befallen your
friend?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno ez ye could jes’ call it a accident,
Doc. It’s jest a little shootin’ scrape,
that’s all, an’ I reckon ye’d better take some
’stracters erlong.”</p>

<p>In accordance with the honest miner’s suggestion
I did take some bullet extractors with
me.</p>

<p>“Ye see, Doc,” said Toppy, by way of preparatory
explanation of the case I was about
to see, “this yere friend of mine hez bin down
in ’Frisco fer a spell, an’ might hev staid thar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
a good while longer, only some feller picked a
row with him. Thar wuz a duel, an’ duels
ain’t so pop’lar down ’Frisco way ez they useter
wuz, ’specially when somebody gits hurt. A
real bad accident happened ter th’ uther feller,
an’ he passed in his checks. Jim—that’s
my friend—got a ball in his thigh, whut stuck
thar, and ez he didn’t hev much time to hunt
fer a doctor, he jest come up hyar, whar its
kinder quiet like, an’ we thort we’d hev y’u
sorter look arter the thing. Ye see, Jim won’t
keer to git ’round much fer a few weeks—not
’till that little accident gits blowed over”—and
Toppy’s eyes gleamed humorously.</p>

<p>My friend led me down to the river bank,
and pushing aside a clump of willows revealed
a small, rudely constructed row-boat.</p>

<p>“Ah!” I said, as I took my seat in the somewhat
insecure-looking and cranky little craft,
“It is evident that you have taken your friend
to your own cabin.”</p>

<p>Toppy, as I well knew, had the only abode
on the opposite bank of the river, where,
high up on the hillside, in full though somewhat
distant view of the little town, he had
built a small but neat cabin, which nestled in
the bosom of the hill, looking not unlike a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
child’s playhouse as seen from the town proper.</p>

<p>“Yep,” replied the miner, “thar’s whar
he is. It aint best ter depen’ too much on
pop’larity, ye know, Doc, an’ Jim’ll be a little
safer over thar than in town. Nobody goes
ter my place—less’n I invite ’em,” and Toppy
grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>I recalled the fate of a poor devil who did
go to his cabin without an invitation—from
Toppy—in the early days of his housekeeping
on the hillside, when a more or less charming
little Mexican half-breed damsel was said to
have presided over Toppy’s domestic affairs.</p>

<p>Being averse to the discussion of other people’s
family matters, I had never conversed
with my miner friend on that delicate subject.
To tell the truth, there seemed to be very little
encouragement for gossip in Jacksonville—town-talk
was too direct a cut to the little collection
of white head-boards that decorated a
small plateau just outside the town. All my
information on such subjects, was therefore
derived from more subtle and less dangerous
airy rumor.</p>

<p>The river was quite low, and a few vigorous
pulls from Toppy’s stalwart arms brought us
to the opposite shore, from which I could see,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
far up the hillside, the gleaming white walls
of the miner’s rude little home, where lay my
prospective patient.</p>

<p>Toppy was notoriously careless in his personal
grooming, but the little half-breed had
evidently inspired a coat of whitewash for the
cabin, that endured longer than the sentiment
with which its owner had inspired that swarthy
little traitress. Possibly that gleaming white
cabin was her monument—who knows? The
river ran dangerously and temptingly near,
considering how short a time it takes to fall
a few hundred feet down a steep and rocky
hillside, and rumor whispered that Pepita—well,
no one knew where she was, and women
were not so plentiful in the Tuolumne valley
that hiding was easy.</p>

<p>But the Tuolumne kept its secret well, if
secret there was. Its quick-sands told no
tales. They could hide the precious gold of
the river bottom; why not a mouldering skeleton?</p>

<p>On entering Toppy’s cabin, completely
winded after my climb up the hill that constituted
his front yard, I found my new patient
lying on a cot in the middle of the room.
He turned inquiringly toward the door as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
host and I entered, and what was my amazement
to see reflected in the dim light of the
candle with which the cabin was illuminated,
the features of the handsome unknown of the
San Francisco gambling-house, whose adventure
with the unfortunate young southerner
I have already related. The recognition
was evidently mutual, but I fancied that
my patient looked at me with an expression
slightly suggestive of annoyance.</p>

<p>Toppy’s introduction was laconic, and as
characteristic as was he himself:</p>

<p>“Doc, this is Jim—Jim, this yer’s Doc Weymouth,
an’ he’s all right, y’u bet, ’specially on
bullets an’ sich things.”</p>

<p>I was used to California customs, hence the
cognomen, “Jim” was sufficiently comprehensive
and perfectly satisfactory to me, and after
the brief introduction that my miner friend
gave me, I proceeded to investigate the case.</p>

<p>As Toppy had already informed me of the
circumstances that led to the reception of my
patient’s wound, I made no inquiry in that direction.
I found also, that Toppy was correct
as to the location of the injury—as he had said,
the ball had entered his friend’s thigh.</p>

<p>The wound had been inflicted several days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
before I saw my patient, and would probably
have healed promptly enough if it had not been
for the weary ride he had taken immediately
after the shooting—-he had come to Jacksonville
on horse back. The result of the necessary
movement in the saddle, together with the hot
sun and dust of the roads, had been to produce
considerable inflammation of the injured part.
I presume that nowadays the surgeon would
seek for no other cause than germ infection for
such a condition as followed the wound which my
patient had received—but at that time things
were different; the various sources of irritation
to which he had been exposed were a reasonable
explanation of the state in which I found
his wound.</p>

<p>The wound was merely muscular, neither
important vessels nor bone having been injured,
and, much to my gratification, I almost immediately
succeeded in finding and extracting
the ball.</p>

<div id="ip_42" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl">“JIM WAS BOUNDING TOWARD THE OPEN DOOR,
LEAVING HIS INSULTER LYING UPON THE
FLOOR WITH A CLEAN CUT IN HIS CHEST”</div></div>

<p>Jim, as I will now call him, stood my manipulations
and the cutting necessary for the
extraction of the bullet without the slightest
indication that such operations were not an
every-day experience with him. This was not
without its effect upon Toppy, who looked upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
his heroic friend with all the pride and tenderness
imaginable.</p>

<p>When I was first introduced to the wounded
man, he had merely nodded his head in greeting.
He did not speak thereafter, until I had
finished dressing the wound, Toppy meanwhile
answering all necessary questions. It seemed to
me, also, that my patient rather avoided scrutiny
of his countenance. He either averted his
face or shaded it with his hand, under the
pretense that the flickering light of the candle
which Toppy held for me affected his eyes,
during the entire time of my surgical attention.</p>

<p>I gave this circumstance hardly a second
thought; nothing seemed more natural than
that my patient should desire to conceal any
little involuntary expression of suffering that
might have disturbed his features during my
exceedingly painful manipulations. I was struck,
however, by his conduct as I was preparing to
leave.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “I am very sorry that my
old friend, Toppy, insisted upon calling you
to-night. I could have stood the racket till
morning, and your rest was much more important
than my worthless existence. I appreciate
your kindness, sir, and wish that I could reciprocate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
in some more fitting manner than by
mere financial compensation. However that’s
the best I can do now;” saying which, my
patient reached beneath the rude mattress upon
which he was lying, drew out a bag of gold,
and without further ceremony handed it to me.</p>

<p>“I wish it might have been more, doctor,” said
Jim, “but I came away from ’Frisco in a deuce
of a hurry, and without heeling myself properly.
However, I have divided evenly with you, and
I believe such a rate of compensation is usually
considered fair by professional men,” and he
smiled somewhat mischievously, his black eyes
twinkling with humor.</p>

<p>My heart warmed toward my patient, I knew
not why. It certainly was not because of his
liberality, for that was common enough in that
rude mining town, where the people were so
crude as to believe that a physician’s services
should be liberally compensated. I kept no
books in those days, my patients were so wild
and uncivilized that I did not find it necessary.</p>

<p>“I will see you again to-morrow, sir,” I said, as
I nodded in recognition of the liberal fee that
my interesting patient had given me, and extended
my hand to bid him good-morning—for
it was then long past midnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
“Oh, no,” replied Jim, hastily, “it will probably
not be necessary, and my friend, Toppy,
here, who is an exceptionally good nurse, can
give me all the attention I require. Be assured,
sir, that you shall be called in again if anything
unfavorable arises. There’s something healing
in the California air. The bullet is out and as I
can rest quietly in Toppy’s cabin, there will be
no further trouble, I am sure. I have been
there before, Doctor,” and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“Very well then,” I said, “if you insist on
assuming the responsibility of your own case,
I suppose I have no right to protest. Remember
your promise, however, and call me at the
slightest intimation of trouble. I will learn how
you are, from time to time, through Toppy, and
if I should at any time hear an unfavorable
report, I might be discourteous enough to call
without an invitation.”</p>

<p>“I think we understand each other, Doctor,”
replied Jim, “and now I believe I’ll take a nap;
sleep has been a scarce commodity with me
for a few days past.”</p>

<p>As I left the cabin I could not rid myself
of the impression that there was something
strangely familiar about my patient. My first
acquaintance with him was certainly the night of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the affair at the Palace in San Francisco, and yet,
he impressed me differently from what might
have been expected in meeting an entire stranger.
I had an ill defined impression that Jim had been
a factor in my life before. But when, and where?
My mind was a blank upon this point, nor was
I likely to become enlightened, considering the
lack of encouragement with which inquiries into
the personal histories of the early California
citizen were usually met.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the bank of the river on
our return to the town, Toppy safely secured
his little boat to the overhanging willows and
insisted on escorting me back to the hotel. Although
this was unnecessary, I was very glad
to have the kind-hearted fellow’s company, the
more especially as I desired to learn something
of my new and interesting patient.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Tuolumne House, I said—“Toppy,
you have furnished me the opportunity
of losing my sleep, and I propose to get
even. It is almost daylight, and we may as well
make a full night of it. I want to know more
of your friend Jim. I don’t know why, but he
greatly interests me. Not but that I am always
interested in my patients, but my feeling toward
your friend is rather a peculiar one. Suppose we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
find a quiet seat somewhere and talk a little
about him?”</p>

<p>Toppy acquiesced, and having declined the
cigar I proffered him, in favor of a stubby black

ourselves upon an old stump, a little way from
the hotel.</p>

<p>“Well, Doc, I don’t s’pose it’s ness’ary fer
me ter tell y’u that Jim’s my best friend. He’s
the best I ever hed, since—well, since I come
from the States. I’ve got good reasons fer likin’
him, ez you’ll obsarve.</p>

<p>“I fust met Jim at Angel’s Camp, about three
years ago. I was prospectin’ round in Calaveras
county, an’ used ter make my headquarters at
Angel’s.</p>

<p>“I used ter booze a lot in them days—mor’n
I do now, Doc. I guess my hide was stretchier
then, an’ used ter hold more. I was allus a
leetle bit excitable when I was drunk, an’ everlastin’ly
gittin’ inter trouble. That’s how I fell
in with Jim.</p>

<p>“I happened to be raisin’ partickler h—l
round town one night, an’ drifted inter Ned
Griffiths place. I’d been thar lots uv times, an’
ez everybody in Angel’s knowed me, an’ I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
was purty poplar, I’d never hed no trouble, till
this night I’m tellin’ y’u about.</p>

<p>“It jest happened that a crowd uv fellers hed
come down from Murphy’s camp ter have a
little fun on ther own account, an’ it was jes’
my d—d luck ter run agin the gang ’bout the
time they was beginnin’ ter feel ther oats purty
lively, an’ of course, I hed ter git into a muss
with ’em.</p>

<p>“Ez I didn’t hev no friends in the place at
the time, an’ folks don’t mix in other fellers’
rows much in the diggin’s, I was buckin’ agin
a dead tough game. Ez luck’d hev it, I happened
ter git mixed up with the toughest cuss in the
crowd—Three Fingered Jack, a feller what’ll
ornyment a tree yit, y’u see if he don’t!<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></p>

<p>“I got my gun out, all right, but the d—d
thing was outer fix, an’ if it hadn’t been, I was
too bilin’ drunk ter hit a cow at three paces.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack jest played with me with his
knife, kinder carvin’ me up on the installment
plan, ye know. He’d socked a few purty good
sized holes inter my ole carkiss, an’ was gittin’
ready ter finish up the job in good shape, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Jim come in an’ took a han’ in the game with
his own little bowie.</p>

<p>“I was too full er booze ter ’preciate the show,
but they do say ez how Jim did a purty neat
job. Jack got well arter a while, but he didn’t
act very sosherble with the folks at Angel’s
enny more.”</p>

<p>“When I found out how Jim had saved my
life, y’u kin bet I didn’t lose no time a looking
him up an’ squarin’ myself. I’d heard er Jim
afore, an’ I knowed he was a gambler by perfession,
but he played a game that night, that
made a big winnin’ fer yores trooly, an’ I’ve
jest bin layin’ fer a chance ter do him a good
turn ever since. He may be a gambler, but
he plays a squar’ game—an’ poker at that—that’s
why they call him ‘Poker Jim.’ He’s
a gentleman born an’ bred, that’s dead sartin,
an’ he’s got more eddication an’ squar’ness
than a hull lot er people whut never gambled
in ther lives. When Poker Jim makes a promise,
it’s kept. If he shud borrer a thousan’
dollars uv me—an’ he could hev it too, if I hed
it, you bet! an’ he shud say, ‘Lookee hyar,
Toppy, I’ll give this back to yer nex’ Monday
et five o’clock,’ an’ he wasn’t on han’ with the
stuff, w’y, then I’d know that suthin had happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
to him. Poker Jim’ll keep enny promise
that he makes, if he’s alive when the time
fer squar’in things comes.”</p>

<p>“You have excellent reasons for loyalty to
your friend Jim,” I said. “He certainly deserves
your friendship and respect, no matter
what his occupation may be. I have met him
before, and under circumstances that proved
him to be a truly noble character. But tell
me, Toppy, how does it happen that you and
Jim drifted apart?”</p>

<p>“Well, ye see, Doc, ’twas this way. The
folks up at Angel’s got so virtoous arter a while,
that gamblers was too rich fer ’em, an’ they
ordered all the gams ter vamoose. Jim got
ketched in the round-up ’long with the rest,
an’ hed ter git out ’twixt the light uv two days.
He couldn’t lick ’em all, less’n they’d come
on one at a time, so he jest played git up an’
git with t’other sports. He went to Frisco
ter play higher stakes than Angel’s Camp
could put up, an’ I came down hyar. Ye see,
I wasn’t none too pop’lar, on account er standin’
up fer Jim, an’ ez I don’t gin’rally fergit ter say
my say, I got inter a little argyment with one
uv the prominent citizens uv Angel’s one day.
I was sober on that erkasyun an’, well—I come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
down ter Jacksonville fer my health. I writ
ter Jim ez soon ez I got hyar, an’ told him whar
I was, an’ ez soon ez he got inter trouble he
knowed whar ter find a fren’ whut’ll stan’ by
him ez long ez ther’s a shot in ther locker—savvy?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “Poker Jim will soon be able
to take care of himself again, and I hope he
will not experience any annoyance from his
recent duelling experience. He certainly is
possessed of great courage, and I should dislike
to see his bravery get him into further
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Y’u kin jest bet Jim’s got sand! Y’u air
all right on that pint, Doc. Thar ain’t no
braver man livin’. D’ye know whut I seed
him do one night up ter Sonora? Well, thar
was eight of us fellers went up thar ter a fandango,
an’ Jim went along ter kinder give the
thing a little tone, ye know.</p>

<p>“‘Mericans aint none too pop’lar with the
greasers nohow, ’cept with their women folks,
an’ them fellers up thar was jes’ bilin’, when
they seed us come inter ther ole fandango.
When we got ter cuttin’ ’em out with their
black eyed senoritas, they was ugly enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
ter slit our throats, en it was jest our blind
luck that fin’ly kep’ ’em from doin’ it.</p>

<p>“Jim don’t often drink enny licker, but he
was a feelin’ purty good that night, an’ jest
spilin’ fer a row with the d—d greasers. Things
was goin’ too slow fer him, so he takes a piece
er chalk, goes out inter the middle of the hall
an’ draws a great big ’Merican eagle on the
floor. Then he pulled his gun an’ called for
some d—d greaser ter step on the bird! We
seed he was in for it, an’ gathered ’round him
ready fer the music ter begin. Each side
was waitin’ fer t’other ter open the ball, when
the feller what run the hall blowed the lights
out. We grabbed Jim an’ hustled him out,
an’ made him take leg bail ’long with the rest
uv us. He wanted ter go back, but we wouldn’t
hev it—the game was jest a little too stiff fer us,
y’u bet! Oh, yes, Poker Jim is dead game,
all right.</p>

<p>“An’ now, Doc, I’m goin’ ter tell ye suthin’
on the dead quiet. Jim’s got a wife an’ child
down in Frisco. He married a little Spanish
gal about two years ago, an’ she was a bute, I
kin tell ye! They’ve got a little baby a year
ole, an’ Jim’s the proudes’ feller y’u ever seed.
Ez soon ez that Frisco scrape is through with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
he’s goin’ ter send fer his family, an’ I’m goin’
ter quit my cabin an’ let Jim an’ his folks hev
it. My place is kinder outer the way an’ private
like, an’ that’ll jest suit Jim.”</p>

<p>“Well, Toppy,” I said, “I am more interested
in your friend than ever, and I hope
that you may soon consummate your plans to
domicile him and his family among us.”</p>

<p>Day was now breaking, and the voice of the
devout Dave Smuggins could be heard ringing
through the halls and vibrating the very roof
of the hotel, as he hoarsely shouted his pious
appeal to the slumbering boarders.</p>

<p>Toppy accompanied me to the hotel bar
and joined me in an “eye-opener,” after which
he bade me good morning and returned home,
while I prepared to do full justice to Keyse’s
immortal flapjacks.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>As Toppy had planned, Poker Jim subsequently
became a citizen of Jacksonville. Advices
from San Francisco showed the excitement
caused by the duel to be practically over after
a few weeks, and, his wound having healed, my
patient quietly installed himself among the
sporting element of our population, resuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the occupation that had earned for him the sobriquet
of “Poker Jim.”</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Jacksonville had often
heard of the cool, quiet gentleman who had
called down and cut up Three Fingered Jack.
Many of his fellow townsmen knew him personally.
No questions were asked therefore, when
Poker Jim quietly and unostentatiously identified
himself with our thriving town. Nor did
the citizens become more inquisitive, when,
a short time afterward, Jim’s family arrived
and took possession of Toppy’s cabin. A few
curious looks were bestowed on Toppy, when
it was learned that he had given up his cabin to
the gambler and his family and had taken quarters
at the Tuolumne House. Curiosity being at
a discount in our little burg, however, and Toppy
being inclined to keep his own counsel, there
was no disposition to press matters to the point
of disturbing his serenity.</p>

<p>The same conservative tendency with which
the towns-people regarded the arrangement
between Toppy and his friend Jim, also protected
the family of the latter from intrusion.
Jim never alluded to his domestic affairs, and,
as Toppy did all of the necessary chores and
errands for his friend’s family, the personnel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of the latter was entirely a matter of speculation.</p>

<p>Despite the social prejudice which even a
mining town entertains against the professional
gambler, however leniently his occupation may
be regarded, Poker Jim became very popular.
His squareness and undisputed courage, associated
with his quiet, unobtrusive demeanor and
the never-failing accuracy with which he handled
his revolver, gained for him an esteem which, if
it was not respect, had about the same market
value as that sentimental commodity.</p>

<p>Jim’s field of operation was necessarily such
that I did not often come in contact with him.
I had endeavored to cultivate him at first, but
he seemed to be decidedly averse to continuing
my acquaintance and even appeared to avoid
me, much to my bewilderment. I often wondered
why he should have conducted himself so
strangely, and also why his appearance and
ways seemed so familiar. I sometimes wished
I might have the opportunity of conversing
with him, but he so persistently avoided me
that I finally gave up all hope of ever learning
more about him.</p>

<p>Time passed quickly in Jacksonville, and in
the pressure of work that was forced upon me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
by numerous cases of rheumatism and other
effects of exposure during the stormy weather
of the winter season, I found plenty to occupy
my attention, hence I heard very little of the
affairs of our people at large, for some time. I
was therefore quite surprised one evening to
find that my fellow citizens were in a state of
rather pronounced excitement, and, incidentally,
greatly concerned about the moral status
of our community.</p>

<p>It seemed that a wave of moral purification
had been gradually passing through the mining
region from one town and camp to another and
the fever of moral reaction had finally struck
Jacksonville.</p>

<p>At a more or less informal meeting held at
the Tuolumne House, at which Tennessee Dick
presided with more enthusiasm than knowledge
of parliamentary law, it was finally decided
that the gambling element of Jacksonville was
a superfluous and dangerous quantity in the
body social, and must therefore be removed—and
that quickly. With the gambling fraternity
there was included in a sweepingly condemnatory
resolution, certain other unwholesome
elements in our primitive social system—of
the feminine persuasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
It was noticeable that those of our citizens
whose losses at the gambling table were largest
and most recent, or whose morals in other directions
were least worthy of commendation,
were the noisiest champions of social reform. As
is usually the case with meetings where the dominant
impulse is to pretend a virtue though
one has it not, the party of reform—and noise—carried
the day.</p>

<p>The meeting was well timed, for the only
man who might have interposed an objection
to the sweeping tone of the final resolution
was absent from town—Toppy had been in
Stockton for several weeks. Poor fellow! He
remained in blissful ignorance of the social
revolution that menaced the safety of Poker
Jim, until long after it was too late to defend
his friend—in this world at least.</p>

<p>Public opinion developed into concerted popular
action very quickly in California mining
towns, and by the following morning, due
notice had been served on every individual who
was in any way identified with the undesirable
element of the population, to leave town within
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Most of the persons who were ordered to
move on, had been in similar straits before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
and were constantly on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui vive</i> of expectation
of some such emergency. As practice
makes perfect, and delay is not healthful after
one has been told to leave a mining town for the
good of its morals, the majority of the tabooed
ones took time by the forelock and decamped
early. Indeed, by nightfall, everybody who
had been given the ultimatum by the citizens,
had departed—with one exception.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It was nearly midnight of the day of the
exodus. A large party of our citizens were
congregated in the bar-room of the Tuolumne
House, discussing the important event that had
so effectually cleared the moral atmosphere
of our town. The subtle essence of sanctity
apparently had already pervaded our social
fabric.</p>

<p>Mutual congratulations had been in order for
some time, and the resultant libations had
considerably disturbed the equilibrium of the
crowd. Each man, however, felt that he was a
thoroughly good fellow, and that everybody
else present was pretty good. There was not
a man in the crowd who did not feel that he was
a modern Hercules, jubilating after the successful
accomplishment of a task beside which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
ancient prototype’s experience as chambermaid
in the Augean Stables, was but a trifling thing
indeed. Commingled with the self-congratulations
of these moral reformers, were boastful
remarks expressive of the awful things the
speakers would have done, had not the persons
who had contaminated the very air of our little
burg, opportunely left in good season after
having received their “notice to quit.”</p>

<p>The proceedings of the extempore mutual-admiration
society-of-social-purists were at their
height, and our citizens were fast becoming
inflated to a superlative degree, when a step
was heard on the hotel porch, the door opened,
and there on the threshold, with a smile of
mocking gravity upon his handsome face, stood—Poker
Jim!</p>

<p>He had evidently been riding hard, for his
boots and clothing were covered with the red
dust of the Tuolumne roads, and his long curly
hair was in a condition of dusty confusion that
was totally unlike his usual immaculateness.</p>

<p>The sudden quiet that fell upon the noisy
crowd was something phenomenal, and as a
disinterested observer I was duly impressed by
it. My fellow townsmen were not cowards, but
they were now face to face with a quality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
bravery which was more than physical indifference
to danger. Poker Jim was a man
whose presence conveyed the impression of
great intellectual and moral power—and it was
not without pronounced effect upon those
rude miners.</p>

<p>“Good evening, gentlemen,” said Jim, blandly,
“I hope I’m not intruding on this scene of
festivity and rejoicing”—and he looked about
him somewhat sarcastically. “As you do not
seem at all disturbed by my presence,” he
continued, “I conclude that my company is
at least unobjectionable, and with your permission
I will join your party,” and Jim strode
up to the Bar, his huge spurs clinking a merry
defiance as he walked.</p>

<p>“You see, gentlemen,” he continued, “I
have a very important engagement which will
temporarily necessitate my absence from town,
and as I start early in the morning, I thought
I would drop in and bid my fellow citizens
good bye. It will save you the trouble of
sending a committee to see me off—I prefer
that you should not give yourselves any trouble
on my account. Should you, however, appoint
a committee to escort me back to town again, I
shall not object. Indeed, I should feel obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
to you if you would turn out <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> and greet
me with a brass band. And, now, fellow
townsmen, friends and former patrons, have a
parting drink with me. I see your hand but
cannot call you.”</p>

<p>Whether it was because liquor was just then
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en régle</i>, the spontaneous revival of Jim’s popularity,
or his cool, sarcastic assurance, is an
open question, but the crowd fell to with a will,
and everybody, with the exception of one man,
drank with him. For the moment it seemed
as though our citizens had forgotten that Jim
was under the ban.</p>

<p>Among the party which had been celebrating
the reform movement of our enterprising town,
was a fellow by the name of Jeff Hosking, a
comparatively recent addition to our population,
who hailed from Murphy’s Camp. Whether
Hosking had an old time grudge to settle with
Poker Jim, no one ever knew, but it was afterward
rumored that a feud of long standing
had existed between them.</p>

<p>From whatever cause, however, the gentleman
from Calaveras remained conspicuously
apart from his sociable companions, insolently
shaking his head in refusal of Jim’s proffered
hospitality. To accentuate his discourtesy—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
such conduct was considered the acme of
rudeness in our little community—he smiled
in a manner that was an unpleasant combination
of superciliousness and contempt.</p>

<p>The assembled company looked at Jeff in
open mouthed astonishment for a few seconds,
but Jim affected not to notice the implied
insult, much to the bewilderment of the rest
of the party.</p>

<p>The situation was, to say the least, embarrassing,
and Dixie, with a pardonable desire
to smooth things over, <span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“Well, Jeff, what’s the matter; hev y’u lost
yer appetite fer licker?”</p>

<p>“No sirree, Mister Dixie!” replied Hosking,
“but I ain’t drinkin’ with no gamblers jest now,
’specially them that ain’t on the squar’, an’
some folks that I knows of, hain’t improved
much since they was chased outer Murphy’s.”</p>

<p>“Drink your liquor, gentlemen,” said Jim,
quietly, “and then we will investigate this
very interesting affair!”</p>

<p>The liquor having been disposed of, Jim
lounged leisurely toward his insulter, looked
him steadily in the eye for a moment and then
<span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“And some people’s manners have not greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
improved since <em>they</em> left Murphy’s. As for my
squareness, that’s a matter for argument, but
one which you are hardly competent to pass an
opinion upon, unless you have changed greatly
in the last few years. Now, Mr. Hosking,
I’m going to tell you something that may
interest you.</p>

<p>“At nine o’clock this morning, I was notified
to change my location within twenty-four
hours. I propose to get away from town as
quietly and pleasantly as possible. Let me
inform you, however, that until nine o’clock
to-morrow morning, I am a citizen of Jacksonville,
and shall stand for my rights and self-respect
accordingly.”</p>

<div id="ip_63" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29em;">
  <img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="463" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl">“THERE WAS A SHORT, SHARP STRUGGLE, A HARMLESS
SHOT, AND JIM’S INSULTER WAS LYING
ON THE FLOOR WITH A CLEAN CUT IN HIS CHEST”</div></div>

<p>Emboldened by Jim’s apparent indisposition
to begin a row, and, like all bullies, mistaking
conservatism for cowardice, Hosking replied:</p>

<p>“Y’u make a mighty purty speech, mister
man, but y’u aint on the squar’ jest the same,
an’ I—”</p>

<p>We never knew what Hosking was going to
say; his mouth was slapped so quickly that his
intentions became a matter for conjecture.</p>

<p>It was impossible to see exactly what happened
next—the two men sprang at each other
so fiercely. There was a short, sharp struggle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
a shot from Hosking’s revolver, that sped
harmlessly over the heads of the crowd, lodging
in the wall, and Jim, bowie in hand, was bounding
toward the open door, leaving his insulter
lying upon the floor with a clean cut in his
chest through which his life was ebbing away
as fast as the escaping blood could carry it!</p>

<p>As Jim ran, some one in the crowd fired a
shot after him. Everybody rushed to the door,
but he was in the saddle and away, amid a
shower of pistol balls, which, much to my
relief, apparently flew wide of their mark.</p>

<p>I was so interested in the safety of the fugitive
that I forgot poor Jeff, and, with a pang of
remorse, I hastened back to his side, only to
find that Poker Jim’s work had been too skillful
for any surgeon to undo. The man was dead!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>With the killing of Hosking, well deserved
though it may have been, Poker Jim’s popularity
was a thing of the past. While under the
ban of public sentiment, he had killed a reputable
citizen of Jacksonville in a quarrel—he was
now an outlaw, upon whose head a price was
set. But he was not to be caught.</p>

<p>No one supposed that Jim would be mad
enough to venture near his cabin, even to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
his wife and child, yet the citizens set a watch
over the place as a matter of ordinary precaution,
and for the purpose of learning her
destination whenever his wife should undertake
to follow and join her husband. I, meanwhile,
saw that Jim’s family wanted for nothing, a
duty in which the sentiment of the town duly
supported me, for, rude as they were, our
people were tender-hearted to a fault. With
uncouth yet delicate discernment the boys
kept away from the little cabin, hence no
visitor but myself ever crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Toppy’s description of Jim’s wife had not
been overdrawn—she was indeed beautiful,
and as charming a woman as I ever met. She
was plucky too—she was apparently not at all
uneasy about her husband, and seemed to have
perfect confidence in his ability to take care of
himself. The child, a boy, resembled his
father, and was such a sweet, pretty little
fellow that I fell quite in love with him. The
little one vaguely recalled to my mind a little
curly-headed boy baby that I used to tote about
when I was a lad, and who, I thought, was the
cutest little brother that a boy ever had. I
resolved that Jim’s family should not want a
friend as long as I could care for them. Toppy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
loyalty I well knew, and I was therefore sure
of being ably seconded on his return from
Stockton.</p>

<p>But our towns-people were soon to have
more important matters to think about than
the capture of Poker Jim.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The latter part of the winter of 1860, and
the early spring of 1861, will never be forgotten
by the inhabitants of the Tuolumne valley.
I certainly have reason to remember it as long
as I may live.</p>

<p>As I have already intimated, the spring
freshets of the California valleys were a matter
of yearly experience. The inhabitants had
become accustomed to them and had usually
been able to escape serious disaster, hence they
had never quite realized what the elements
could do at their worst.</p>

<p>The winter had been a hard one; there had
been an excessive rainfall, and reports from the
mountain towns showed a greater amount of
snow than had ever before been experienced
in that region. When the mountain snows
began to melt, therefore, and the terrific storms
characteristic of the breaking up of the winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
season came on, an enormous volume of water
began pouring down into the valleys, which
was as alarming as it was unprecedented.</p>

<p>We had heard vague rumors of serious
trouble in the valleys of the Sacramento and
San Joaquin, and, as the Tuolumne had risen to
a point hitherto unheard of, the oldest settlers
became somewhat uneasy.</p>

<p>Fearing lest the Tuolumne—which was fast
becoming a raging torrent—might eventually
become impassable, I saw that “Mrs. Jim,” as
I used to call her, was well supplied with
necessaries. I knew that the water rise would
be of short duration—for so tradition had it—hence
I was not uneasy about my interesting
charges.</p>

<p>The river had finally risen to a point nearly
two feet beyond the highest water mark ever
known; it then began to subside and we felt
much easier—the end was apparently in sight.
But we deceived ourselves most thoroughly.</p>

<p>The people of Jacksonville, congratulating
themselves on the beginning of the end of the
greatest freshet in their experience, retired one
night to sleep in fancied security, only to be
rudely awakened the following morning by
the surging of the waters of the Tuolumne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
against the very beds on which they slept.
The water was seeking its revenge—a revenge
that was soon to be fully accomplished.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours there was but one
safe point in the entire town—the high ground
upon which stood the Tuolumne House. Practically
every other building in town, save one,
was washed away. One sturdy miner upon
whom fortune had smiled, had built himself a
pretty little cottage, which he determined to
save. He passed a cable through a door and
a window at the corner of the house, and guyed
it to a huge tree upon a hill opposite. The
cottage swung about at the end of the rope
until the waters subsided, when the triumphant
miner anchored it in a new location, this time
on higher ground—the original site of his home
having gently slipped into the river. But Nelson
was an exception; his brother miners were not so
fortunate.</p>

<p>The hotel was full to overflowing and tents
were at a premium. Mining was a forgotten
industry. The chief occupation of the citizens
was counting noses to see who was missing,
and fishing up such articles of value as they
could from amid the debris of the flood. For
entertainment they counted the buildings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
studied the wreckage that the waters brought
down from the towns and camps higher up the
valley. An occasional corpse was seen floating
along among the flotsam and jetsam carried
past by the raging river—a ghastly reminder
of the seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>Almost directly opposite the Tuolumne House
was a dam in the river. There were times
during the dry season when the Tuolumne
was so low that one could walk across via this
dam. Now, however, it was a veritable Niagara.
It was interesting, as well as harrowing,
to watch the destruction of the buildings as
they toppled over the brink and broke up.
Occasionally a house, larger than the rest,
would lodge at the dam for some time before
going over. At one point quite a mass of
debris had collected and bade fair to remain
indefinitely blocked up against a projecting
part of the dam.</p>

<p>Just beyond the further end of the dam I
could see Toppy’s little cabin, gleaming white
and clearly cut against the dark green background
of the hillside whereon it stood, far out
of the way of all possible danger from the
rising waters.</p>

<p>A group of our citizens was standing on safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
ground near the hotel, quietly discussing the
apparently hopeless misery and total destruction
that had befallen our industrious little
town, when our attention was attracted by a
house, larger than any we had yet seen, which
came drifting rapidly down the stream in full
view.</p>

<p>As the house came nearer, Dixie called out—“By
G—d, boys! thar’s a man in the winder!”</p>

<p>And so there was, and a badly frightened
one at that! As he came well within sight, he
could be seen waving a garment of some kind
in wild and emphatic signals of distress. His
voice could soon be heard, calling for assistance
in a series of wild yells that would have done
credit to an Indian war-dance.</p>

<p>There was great excitement among my fellow
citizens for a few moments, and groans of
despair at our inability to rescue the stranger
were plentiful, when suddenly some one in the
crowd <span class="locked">yelled—</span></p>

<p>“Oh, h—l! It’s a d—d Chinaman, ez sure ez
shootin’!”</p>

<p>And so it proved to be.</p>

<p>I trust that the philanthropy of my fellow
townsmen will not be underestimated, if I
frankly state that an unmistakable sigh of relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
went up from the crowd when it was discovered
that the poor devil whose fate it had
just been bewailing, was a despised Mongolian.</p>

<p>The nationality of the hapless passenger in
the floating house and the hopelessness of an
attempt at rescue, even, if our citizens had been
so disposed, served to silence the spectators of
the Chinaman’s fate. In justice to my old
friends, I will state that I have never doubted
that an effort to save the luckless Mongolian
would have been made, had any means of rescue
been at hand. Not a boat was left in town, and
even had there been a hundred at our disposal,
it looked like certain death to attempt to
traverse the terrific torrent that confronted us.</p>

<p>The Chinaman was apparently clearly doomed,
and the end was only a question of minutes,
a fact which the poor fellow himself appreciated
even more keenly than we did, as was
shown by the renewed vigor of his frantic cries
for assistance, as he caught sight of the dam
that his strange craft was so rapidly nearing.</p>

<p>But, as Big Brown was wont to say, “Nobody
hez sich good luck ez er fool, ’ceptin’ a
d—d Chinaman.” The house in which the
luckless voyager was making his unwilling
and terrible journey, caught upon the debris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
that had accumulated near the center of the
dam! Here it remained poised for an instant,
almost upon the very verge of destruction,
then swinging squarely about in the rushing
current, it lodged broad-side to, in such a
manner that it came to a full stop and remained
motionless.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Chinaman now redoubled
his cries for assistance, and the crowd, in silent
awe, awaited the giving way of the temporary
obstruction and the inevitable destruction of
the house and its unhappy tenant.</p>

<p>A moment later, a man was seen to
emerge from the scrub pines near the water’s
edge upon the opposite side of the river, some
distance below Toppy’s cabin. He was dragging
a small boat, that had evidently been
concealed among the trees.</p>

<p>The man pushed his little craft into the
swift running water, sprang in, and pulled
boldly away from the bank! As he did so, he
stood upright for a moment and turned his
features squarely toward us. Even at that
distance there was no mistaking that magnificent
physique and fearless bearing!</p>

<p>“It’s Poker Jim, by G—d!” cried a number
of men simultaneously. Almost automatically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
several among the crowd drew their pistols
and fired at the far-distant figure—a useless
feat of bravery, as their target was probably
beyond rifle-shot, to say nothing of trying to
hit a man at that distance with a six-shooter.</p>

<p>“Hold on, boys!” cried Big Brown, in astonishment.
“If he aint goin’ arter that d—d
Chinaman I’ll eat my hat! Well, I’ll be kerflummuxed!
If that don’t beat h—l!”</p>

<p>If there was anything the early settlers of the
diggings worshipped, it was reckless, fool-hardy
bravery. From that moment Jim was a hero,
a Bayard, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans peur et sans reproche</i>, before
whose chivalry every man who saw his courageous
act was ready to bow down to the very
earth.</p>

<p>The crowd silently watched Jim for a moment,
and then broke out in a chorus of “bravos!”
and hand clappings which, although they
impressed the object of their admiration not
at all—even if he noticed them, which is doubtful—expressed
in unmistakable language a
sudden change in the sentiment of our towns-people
toward him whom they had so recently
outlawed.</p>

<p>The first burst of applause over with, we
watched the brave fellow in almost breathless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
anxiety, as he skilfully directed his little boat
toward the house, the Chinaman meanwhile
having stopped his yelling for the moment,
in anticipation of the approach of his rescuer.</p>

<p>Whether Jim had intended to bring up
against the side of the house that lay up-stream,
as seemed wisest, would be difficult to say;
if such was his intention however, he certainly
miscalculated, for his boat disappeared behind
the end of the house which was farthest away
from us.</p>

<p>The rest of the tragedy we could not see, for
we had hardly lost sight of Jim before the
obstructing debris gave way and the house
shot over the dam, sweeping everything before
it!</p>

<p>So died a hero!</p>

<p>A searching party went out a short time
afterward, and, at great risk, found and secured
the body of Poker Jim, battered and bruised,
but still classically handsome and debonair,
even in death. As the boys were sorrowfully
returning to town with the body of the man
whom a few hours before they had tried to kill,
they spied upon a mass of wreckage that had
lodged in a partially submerged tree-top a few
feet from shore, a badly frightened but still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
yelling individual, at the sight of whom Big
Brown almost collapsed.</p>

<p>It was the Chinaman!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Early the next morning, a cortége composed
of every citizen who was able to walk, climbed
slowly and sorrowfully up the road leading
to the little cemetery, just back of town. At
the head of the solemn procession were six
stout miners, hat in hand, bearing upon a rude
stretcher the body of Poker Jim. Just behind
the body, another party was carrying a rough
coffin, composed of pieces of wreckage, hastily
thrown together.</p>

<p>By no means the least sorrowful feature of
the funeral was the fact that we had no means
of communication with the dead man’s wife,
nor did we indeed, even know whether or not
she had witnessed his death.</p>

<p>The cemetery reached, and the body having
been laid in the clumsy coffin beside the grave
which the kind-hearted miners had already
dug, there was an embarrassing <span class="locked">pause—</span></p>

<p>I had been asked to say a few words, in lieu
of a clergyman, and had agreed to do so, on
condition that some one else was selected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
say something in behalf of the mining population
proper. Dixie was selected to coöperate
with me, but was evidently waiting for me to
give him his cue, so I was obliged to open the
services as well as I could.</p>

<p>I was so overcome with emotion that I could
hardly find voice to say a word. I finally
managed, however, to give a brief eulogy of the
dead man, revolving chiefly around the incident
that happened in the San Francisco gambling-house
on the occasion when I met Jim for the
first time. My remarks were received with a
running fire of muttered eulogies of the deceased
hero, which were as sincere as they were inelegant.</p>

<p>Dixie now mustered up the necessary courage,
mounted a stump and began:</p>

<p>“Feller citizens, we air hyar ter do a solemn
dooty. One uv our most prom’nent an’ respected
citizens is a lyin’ hyar dead, an’ we,
ez his fren’s, air hyar ter give him a good send
off. Poker Jim hez passed in his checks; he
hez cashed in fer the las’ time, an’ thar aint
nobody hyar whut’ll say that his last deal
wasn’t a squar one. Sum mout say ez how
Jim was a d—d fool, ter play agin sich a dead
open-an’-shut game, with a d—d Chinaman fer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
stakes, but, my feller citizens, Jim cut the cards
on the squar’, an’ he died ez squar’ ez enny
man that ever stepped in shoe leather.</p>

<p>“An’ Jim died game, an’ with his boots on.
He wasn’t no white-livered coyote, Jim wasn’t.
Ef thar was enny yaller streaks in him, w’y nobody
ever knowed it. He wuz a sandy man
frum way up the creek, y’u bet! He wuz a
dead-game cock fer fair.</p>

<p>“I wish we knowed whut Jim’s States’ name
was, but thar aint nobody hyar ter tell us, an’
ez we hev allus knowed him as Poker Jim, w’y
that’s the name we’ll bury him by. It was
good ’nuff fer him, livin’, an’ it’s good ’nuff fer
us, now that he’s dead.</p>

<p>“I aint no speechifier, ez y’u all know, an’
Doc, hyar, hez done the hansum thing by Jim
in that line, so I aint a goin’ ter spile a good
thing, but I’m jes’ goin’ ter say one thing, an’
say it plain. We all made mistakes on the
diseased. He mout hev been a gambler—I
don’t say ez he wasn’t—but, my fren’s, Poker
Jim was a gentleman, an’ he died like one,
d—d ef he didn’t!” And Dixie looked about
him defiantly, as though challenging dissent
and stamping it as hazardous.</p>

<p>A white head-board, rather more pretentious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
than was the prevailing fashion in Jacksonville,
was erected at Jim’s grave. I was consulted
regarding an epitaph, but could find no fault
with the rudely carved inscription suggested
by <span class="locked">Dixie—</span></p>

<p class="p1 b1 center vspace">
“HERE LIES THE BODY<br />
OF<br />
POKER JIM—GENTLEMAN.”
</p>

<p>A few days later, the flood had subsided
sufficiently to warrant an attempt at crossing
the river. Having succeeded in procuring a
large boat from one of the neighboring towns,
a party of us crossed over to Toppy’s cabin in
quest of Jim’s family.</p>

<p>There had been no sign of life about the
place since the day of Jim’s death, hence I was
not surprised to find the cabin empty. Not a
trace of the dead man’s wife or child could be
found! Nor were they ever heard of again.
Whether the poor little woman had witnessed
the disaster that made her a widow, and the
raging Tuolumne had received the sorrowing,
despairing mother and her innocent child,
we never knew. I have always entertained
a vague hope that Jim had already conveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
them to a place of safety when he met his death.</p>

<p>As our party was searching the cabin for
clews to the disappearance of Jim’s family,
Big Brown found upon a shelf in the little
cupboard where Toppy’s rather primitive supply
of dishes was kept, a letter, carefully sealed,
and addressed to me. He handed me the
letter, and I fancied his voice trembled a little
as he <span class="locked">said—</span></p>

<p>“Well, Doc, Jim never forgot his fren’s. I
don’t know what Toppy’ll say when he gits
back ter town.”</p>

<p>“Poor Toppy,” I said, “It will grieve him
sorely, when he learns that the gallant Jim is
gone forever.”</p>

<p>The burly miner watched me curiously as
I opened and read the letter. The expression of
my face as I read must have startled him, for he
grasped me by the arm and exclaimed, “What’s
the matter, Doc; air y’u sick?” I handed
him the letter and staggered to a chair.</p>

<p>Big Brown laboriously read the letter through
to the end; When he came to the signature
he put his huge hand gently on my shoulder
and said:</p>

<p>“Doc, ye needn’t be ashamed uv relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
like him, even if he was a gambler. Who was
he, anyhow?”</p>

<p>And I was not ashamed as I <span class="locked">answered—</span></p>

<p>“My brother—little Jim.”</p>

<h2 id="TOMMY_THE_OUTCAST">TOMMY THE OUTCAST</h2>
</div>

<p>“Hello, Fido!”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir; did you speak to me?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know me, Fido?”</p>

<p>“Great heavens! Tommy Baker, as I’m alive!
Why, what on earth—?”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder that you are surprised, Fido,
old boy—for I’m not the same Thomas Baker
as of yore. Four years away from the old farm
have wrought great changes in me. Four years
of life in a large city, with its ups and downs,
its luxuries and its hardships, are enough to
demoralize anybody. And still, you look sleek
and comfortable enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Tommy,” replied Fido, “I
am doing tolerably well, that’s a fact. You see,
I’m living with Mrs. Geeswillem—she’s the
wife of old Geeswillem the brewer, you know,
who bought me just after you ran away from
home. I’ve got a mighty soft job, and don’t
you forget it. I have only one complaint to
make, and that is that my mistress insists on
making me wear this measly red blanket, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
this stiff collar with its confounded bells. Then,
too, I have to ride out with her every pleasant
afternoon, and she stuffs me with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon bons</i> and
such truck until I feel like a corner in sugar
stock. Why, Tommy, old chap—do—you—know—I
haven’t even <em>smelled</em> a rat since I
took my present place!”</p>

<p>“Ah, me!” said Tommy, “I haven’t had many
chances to smell anything else for the last two
years, and the rats I <em>have</em> had, haven’t been the
corn-fed article we used to hunt together down
at Baker’s farm, I can tell you. How I miss
’em! And the cream, and buttermilk, and
sausages and—”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Tommy,” cried Fido, “don’t
ever mention sausage to me again! If you only
knew—!”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Fido. In my glowing recollection
of pleasures past, I forgot that you have
been living in the city for some time and have
probably long since discovered that all is not
gold that glitters. There’s many a tragedy imprisoned
within the cover of the city sausage.
And yet, Fido, such reflections should be valuable
to you as inculcating a lesson of Christian
humility. If this be not enough, look at me,
and think how ephemeral is terrestrial glory. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
was once as thou art—fat, pampered, happy, and
with never a thought of the morrow. Ah, my
boy! who can control his own destiny; who can
govern the mysterious workings of fate?”</p>

<p>“Well, Tommy,” said Fido, “you evidently
haven’t regulated yours to any large extent. If
you have, you’d better let somebody else take
the job, for you don’t seem to be making a
brilliant success of it. But tell me, what has
brought you to this? You were as sleek and
dandified a fellow as ever wore whiskers when
I saw you last. Don’t you remember the time
the boys got up that serenade for you and sang
‘Oh he’s a dude, a dandy dude!’ until the roofs
were covered with boot jacks a foot deep?
Whew! but weren’t you mad though?”</p>

<p>“Heigho!” sighed Tommy, “if anybody should
serenade me in that fashion nowadays, I don’t
think I could accuse him of being personal—I
look like ‘the last run o’ shad.’ But you have
asked me for my history since we were on the
farm together. If you have patience to listen
to the yarn of a miserable outcast, I’ll gladly
tell you my story. My appearance makes it
unnecessary for me to remark that I am no longer
Thomas Baker, Esquire, but Tommy the
Tramp, as the haughty young Duchesse de Maltesa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
who lives in the next block, calls me, and
you are likely to lose caste if you are seen talking
with me in public. Let’s make a sneak
into the alley over yonder. There’s a big dry-goods
box over there behind that brick barn
where we can talk without fear of interruption.”</p>

<p>“Why, Tommy Baker!” said Fido indignantly,
drawing himself up to his full height, his eyes
flashing fire. “What do you take me for—a
man? I’ll have you to understand that I never
went back on a friend in my life. Do you suppose
I care a straw for other people’s opinions? Not
a bit of it! I’m all wool and a yard wide, and
don’t you forget it. If it wasn’t necessary to
wear this dandy trash in order to hold my job,
I’d tear it off in a holy minute. Not another
word, sir!—or I’ll roll in the mud and prove to
you that I am your old pard—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">semper fidelis</i>, and
all that—even if I go to the pound for it.”</p>

<p>“Dear old Fido!” cried Tommy, his eyes filling
with tears. “You are indeed worthy of your name.
Greater love than this hath no dog, that
he loseth his job for a friend. But, old fellow, to
be candid with you, I don’t feel as easy as I
might. An awful accident happened this morning
to some dear, sweet, tender little chickens in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
that big yard on the corner, and while my lean
and hungry appearance shows my innocence
only too plainly, it’s best not to take any
chances. Besides, I couldn’t talk freely in this
public place.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tommy,” said Fido, “if that’s the way
you feel, we will do as you suggest. So far as
the chickens are concerned, however, I don’t
think you need any X ray to prove an alibi.”
And Fido glanced pityingly at poor Tommy’s
spectre-like frame and diaphanous hide.</p>

<p>“A little slower, please,” said Tommy, as he
limped along after his friend. “You see, my
left fore-foot is a bit lame—I cut it on a piece
of broken glass the other night. There’s a lot of
miserable, depraved, medical students in a boarding
house over on Ashland Boulevard, who
amuse themselves by throwing beer bottles at
respectable people on the roofs. They never
throw any full ones at a fellow though, you can
just bet on that. It isn’t really safe to venture
out on a roof after dark in that neighborhood.
Why, those cruel devils struck a lady friend of
mine, Mrs. Felida Black, the other night, and
almost broke her tail off!”</p>

<p>“Horrible!” cried Fido. “Why is it that
those two-legged brutes can’t be suppressed?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Well, that comes of being born without a soul.
Such fellows really don’t know any better. There
is a so-called Humane Society here, the business
of which is to look after decent four-footed
people, but it doesn’t do much but pay big
salaries to its officers. The society winks whenever
a ragamuffin throws a brickbat at a fellow,
but just let some doctor operate on us under
chloroform and—My God! Tommy, old fellow,
what’s the matter? Here, lean on my shoulder.
Never mind the blanket—who cares for that?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, Fido, just a little temporary
faintness, that’s all. You see, I—well, I’ll tell
you all about it by and by.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tommy, your dry-goods box is quite
cozy, after all.”</p>

<p>“I fear it hardly comes up to your usual accommodations,”
replied Tommy, “but it is at
least safe, and that’s a very important point
with me. Take a seat on that piece of carpet
over yonder; it’s clean and may be homelike to
you. I? Oh, this straw will do for me. It’s a
trifle musty, but we can’t be too particular in
these democratic times. Are you comfortable?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you,” replied Fido, “You must
remember that I am a country dog in spite of
my cloth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
“Very well, then,” said Tommy, “not being
habituated to that nasty tobacco used by humans,
we will, not light a weed first. I will begin
my story without any such offensive preliminary.</p>

<p>“As you are well aware, my dear Fido, I
was a decent enough fellow in my youth, save
for my somewhat foppish tendencies. Being—ahem!—a
rather handsome chap, you will
recollect that I was quite popular with the ladies.
As is usually the case with such young fellows,
I was at first pampered and then—spoiled. I
remember with keen remorse that practically
all my friends eventually became estranged
from me through my self-conceit. You alone
were loyal, and always ready to defend and advise
me. As for my own family—they had long
since ceased to recognize me when I left the old
place.</p>

<p>“It was the old story—I became very unhappy,
and felt that no one understood or appreciated
me. I did not have sense enough to
understand that it was my own failings that had
caused me to lose my former popularity. I believed
that the coldness of my friends was due
to their jealousy and malicious envy.</p>

<p>“It was not long before I determined, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
‘I’ll show ’em’ desire for revenge, that I would
leave the old farm at the first opportunity, and
seek a field where my talents would be appreciated
at their true value. And then came the
tempter.</p>

<p>“One day while you were away with little
Tod Baker on a fishing excursion, I received a
call from Pete Tucker of Posyville—I don’t
think you ever met him. Pete had seen a good
deal of the world, and his stories of adventure
were perfectly fascinating to me. He had been
to sea several times, had spent a couple of seasons
doing the happy family act with a circus
and, at the time of his visit to me, was living in
Chicago—having come home for a few days’
vacation. He said a great deal about the pleasures
of city life, and informed me that he had
a most delightful situation where he mingled
with the best society and had very little to do
to earn what he described as an enormous salary.</p>

<p>“‘Tommy, my boy,’ he said, slapping me
familiarly on the shoulder, ‘you are a blamed
fool to bury yourself out here in the country!
Come back to the city with me, and I’ll get you
a nice soft berth where you can make something
of yourself.’ I yielded only too readily to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
tempter and long before you returned home, my
dear Fido, I was on my way to Chicago.</p>

<p>“I had never before been in a large city,
hence Chicago unfolded a new world to me—a
world that seemed as fair as I have since found
it to be corrupt.</p>

<p>“Pete had told me the truth, in some respects,
regarding his situation. He was employed as
chief mouser in the bar-room of a fashionable
hotel, and living on the fat of the land. I was
soon installed as assistant mouser, the rat department
being under the management of a
terrier gentleman named Foxy. And now came
my initiation into the mysteries of office-holding.</p>

<p>“It was with all the honest enthusiasm of
youth that I began my duties, and without
noting the methods of my superiors in office I
worked hard day and night in the conscientious
effort to secure the approbation of my employers.
Pete and Foxy observed my industry with
great curiosity at first, and then seemed to be
somewhat amused by my actions. I finally discovered
that they were actually laughing at
me. This bewildered me, and I finally ventured
to ask for an explanation.</p>

<p>“‘Ha! ha! ha!’ laughed my colleagues. ‘What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
a young innocent it is, to be sure!’ ‘Why,’ said
Pete, ‘you couldn’t see through a millstone with
a hole in it! We used to work ourselves to death
just as you are doing, but we’ve got a little
sense nowadays, eh, Foxy?’</p>

<p>“‘You bet your boots, pardner!’ replied the
terrier.</p>

<p>“‘Now, see here, Tommy,’ continued Pete,
‘I’ll tell you just how the thing stands. We
found out long ago that hard work didn’t pay,
and made up our minds to do as little work and
have as good a time as we possibly could.</p>

<p>“‘Among the patrons of this place is a number
of politicians and policemen. I tell you
what, Tommy, those are the boys who are on
to their jobs! Chancing to overhear some of
their conversation at various times, I speedily
discovered that I was making a blamed fool of
myself. I then resolved to hold my job just as
politicians and policemen do.</p>

<p>“‘Foxy and I have come to an understanding
with our rodent friends, and with a little care
on their part, we have managed to avoid all
suspicion that we are not attending strictly to
business.</p>

<p>“‘Once in a while I pick up a dead rat or
mouse in the alley somewhere, and leave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
around where the old man is sure to notice him—see?
Sometimes a strange rodent blows in here,
and forgets to bring his pull with him, and we
nail <em>him</em> to the earth in great shape. I tell you
what, Tommy, work was never made for gentlemen—and
Foxy and I are gents from way back.
We’ve got a soft thing here, and you’re in on it.
Plenty to eat, drink enough to float a ship, and
a soft warm bed. What more could anybody
ask?’</p>

<p>“Alas! Fido, old friend, how alluring to unwary
youth is gilded temptation! I followed
the dishonest advice of my companions and fell
into their evil ways, and like most young persons
of little experience, I was soon anxious to
outdo my models in the extent and variety of
my dissipation. I ate, drank and made merry
with all the abandon of an old timer.</p>

<p>“The example of my associates, bad as it was,
could not be compared with that set for me by
some of the two-legged patrons of the place.
Pete may have been right about their social position,
but of all the vulgar, profane, beastly fellows
I ever saw, the young bloods who frequented
that bar were the worst. But my prejudices
were soon overcome, and I came to believe that
such qualities were absolutely essential to fellowship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
in the smart set of a great city. And so I
continued in my evil ways, my life being one
continual round of hilarious and intemperate
pleasure.</p>

<p>“The outcome was precisely what was to have
been expected. I fell seriously ill, and had it not
been for a splendid constitution derived from my
early life in the country, I most certainly would
have died. I finally became convalescent and
was speculating on how soon I would likely be
able to get to business again, when an unlooked
for complication set in. I caught the mange, and
in a few weeks was a perfect fright. My hide
looked as if it had been plucked out in spots. It
was not long before some of the patrons of the
place noticed my condition and commented sarcastically
upon it to my employer. One man
said I ought to go to the Springs and boil out,
whatever that may mean.</p>

<p>“I received but little consolation from Pete
and Foxy; indeed, they were quite shy of me
after my skin trouble developed, and, as you
might suppose, my life was most miserable.</p>

<p>“But my troubles had only begun. A short
time after this I overheard my employer conversing
with a rough-looking man, who used to
hang about the place doing odd jobs for drinks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
To my consternation, the boss was making arrangements
with that infamous rowdy to take
my life that very night! I listened to the foul
plot with my heart in my mouth. I nearly
fainted, so great was my horror and agitation.
What to do I hardly knew at first. I no longer
had confidence in Pete and Foxy, and would
not ask their advice. I finally determined to
try to make my escape before the fatal moment
should arrive.</p>

<p>“Evening came, and with it my opportunity
to escape. Just at dusk, before the gas was lighted,
I sneaked out of the alley door between the
heels of a customer, and arriving in the open air,
ran as fast as my trembling legs could carry me
until I reached a part of the city far distant
from the hotel where my would-be assassins were
probably even then searching for their intended
victim.</p>

<p>“For some weeks after my escape, I led a
paw-to-mouth existence. Half-starved, despondent,
set upon by strange dogs, stoned by
cruel vicious boys—I often regretted that I
had not permitted my life to be taken by that
ruffian at the hotel. He would have drowned
me, most likely, and death by drowning would
have been far pleasanter than the life I subsequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
led. You may wonder why I did
not commit suicide, but frankly, I hadn’t courage
enough for that. Some folks say that
only cowards commit suicide, but don’t you
ever believe it.</p>

<p>“The horror of my transition from the easy
life at the hotel to that of a homeless, despised
wanderer, was something of which you can
have no conception, my dear Fido, and I sincerely
hope you may never pass through so
terrible an experience as I had at that time
and have been having since I—but I am getting
ahead of my story.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I lived through the terrible
ordeal of starvation and abuse to which
I was subjected. I was inexperienced and
very sensitive to hardships. Nothing could
disturb me now, but then—ah me! How
tender is youth!</p>

<p>“After some weeks of terrible privation and
physical torture, I began to believe that the
fates were against me, when the tide of my
affairs unexpectedly turned.</p>

<p>“I had crawled into an open basement window
in the rear of a modest and unpretentious-looking
house over on Adams Street one stormy
night, hoping to find something to satisfy my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
terrible hunger. To my despair, everything
was under lock and key. Noticing a number
of rat holes about, I determined to make an
attempt to capture a rodent or two for my
supper, and posted myself at the hole that
looked most promising.</p>

<p>“Game was scarce; in my then weakened
state my vigil was too fatiguing and I fell
asleep at my post. When I finally awoke I
was horrified to find myself in the hands of a
woman!</p>

<p>“You better believe I was frightened! Why,
my dear Fido, I never had such a scare in
my life. But fortunately I had no cause for
alarm; my captor—who proved to be the cook—was
most kind to me. She took me up stairs
to the kitchen and gave me a good, substantial
meal and a warm, soft bed. For the first
time in many weeks I passed a comfortable
night, free from the pangs of hunger and unrest.</p>

<p>“When morning came, I of course supposed
I would be told to go. To my delight I was
not only given a sumptuous breakfast, but
nothing was said about my departure, and
I began to hope that I might be able to secure
a permanent position with the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
“After I had finished my breakfast, the
cook disappeared for a few moments. She
soon returned accompanied by two children,
whom she called Johnny and Ethel. They
spoke to me kindly, and Ethel said:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Johnny, let’s ask mamma if we can’t
keep the poor thing!’</p>

<p>“‘Let’s do,’ cried Johnny, delightedly, ‘and I’ll
ask papa to give us some liniment for him, too,
he looks just like he was havin’ the measles.’</p>

<p>“‘Pshaw! me darlints,’ said the cook, ‘d’ye
shpose yer pa’ll be afther docthorin’ cats?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course he will,’ replied Ethel, ‘didn’t he
fix Willie Thompson’s dog when he broke his
leg?’</p>

<p>“Sure enough, my dear Fido, the children’s
papa was a doctor, and he soon cured my skin
trouble. After I was myself again, there was
no longer any danger of being asked to leave,
for the children became very fond of me; even
the baby seemed to take a great fancy to me.</p>

<p>“I got along famously with the children,
although they were a little rough at times.
Johnny was somewhat inclined to be gay
once in a while, but I came out all right. I
remember one close call I had, though. Ethel
wanted to play I was sick one day, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Johnny was a doctor. They gave me some
of the worst stuff a fellow ever tasted—just
held me and poured it down my neck! Then
Master Johnny suddenly discovered that I had
‘tonsillitis,’ whatever that is. He’d heard his
papa use the word, I s’pose. I must be ‘operated,’
the little rascal said, and going into
the doctor’s surgery he got a vicious looking
instrument. Ethel held me, and the amateur
doctor proceeded to plunge his devilish contrivance
down my throat! After fishing up a
few chunks of spleen, and liver, and things,
Johnny let me go, saying, ‘Madam, your child
will get well now.’ I did get well, but my internal
revenue and things have never since felt
just right.</p>

<p>“But Johnny was my friend just the same.
Gosh!—how he did lick a rude, vulgar boy who
threw stones at me one day! ’Twould have
done your heart good to see him.</p>

<p>“Ethel and I used to have some awfully
nice times together. She used to dress me up
in doll’s clothes and play I was a baby. And
then she would put me in a little cradle and
rock me to sleep. The dear child used to be
so pleased because I lay so still, and she used
to say I was ‘a dear, good, sweet little kitty.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
To tell the truth, though, I just had to lie still,
for those long clothes used to trip me up every
time I tried to walk. I did try to sneak away
one time, and fell down stairs and almost
broke my neck.</p>

<p>“But the baby was my special delight. He was
a fat, roly-poly, sweet faced youngster as ever
you saw. His skin was like a pink rose-leaf, and
his mouth was as fresh—well, as fresh as new
milk. Whenever the folks weren’t looking, I
used to climb into the crib and little Harry and
I would have a high old time, I tell you. He
would maul me about for a little while and then
hug and kiss me just awful nice. And then when
we’d got all tired out he would snuggle up close
to me and go to sleep—and I would lie there
quite still and watch him while he slept.</p>

<p>“The folks would catch me in the crib sometimes,
and whew! but then there was a row, and
no mistake! They used to just paralyze me—said
I’d suck the baby’s breath, you know. The
stupids! Why should I do that? I like babies,
but lunching on babyfied air wouldn’t do me in
those days, though it might be substantial
enough now. Human folks have some queer
notions, eh, Fido?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you know, Tommy,” said Fido,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
“that out-of-date ‘sucking the breath’ business
is an old woman’s notion, but humans don’t
seem to have much judgment. They still believe
in miracles and all that, and the breath-sucking
theory shouldn’t surprise you.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of the peculiarities of humanity,
Fido,” said Tommy, “isn’t it queer that humans
don’t like music?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have often noted the fact, on occasions
when I have sung to the moon,” replied
Fido.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy, “the folks at the doctor’s
house used to play on an old rattle-box of
a piano till they fairly made me sick, but just let
me sing ever so little and there was trouble at
once. You will recall that in the old days I
used to be quite proud of my voice. I supposed
that I had some vocal talent left and I have done
a little singing since I came to the city. I fear
however, that my voice is not appreciated here.
My city neighbors were the worst kind of kickers,
and caused me no end of trouble. You see,
there was a young lady cat who lived near us
and—By the way, I didn’t tell you about how I
first fell in love, did I? Well, it was just—the—richest—thing!”—</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt,” exclaimed Fido, hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
interrupting, “but just hear that bell. It’s
nine o’clock and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I was digressing anyway,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>“As I was saying, there was a young lady cat
living near us with whom I will confess I was
somewhat smitten. I used to call on her evenings.
I was too busy to call day-times, and besides,
a tin roof is just awful on a fellow’s feet
when the sun’s out. I often used to serenade her,
accompanying my singing with the violin. She
was very fond of stringed instruments, and especially
the violin. She used to say there was
no musical instrument that was so cat-like and
natural in its tone and feeling. The dear girl—what
exquisite musical taste she had! Ah! how
I loved her! Why, I felt, when in her presence,
as though I were full of vibrating E strings—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au
naturel</i>, but none the less vibrating. And I
mind me well that she was not unresponsive.
Shall I ever forget that mellow September night
when she first confessed she loved me? ‘Ah!
Thomaso,’ she cried—(Thomaso, by the way,
was a feminine conceit of hers; she had been
abroad, you know)—‘Ah! Thomaso, how bleak
and drear were the most pretentious roof without
thee! Where is there such another form, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
voice so sweet as thine? The girl who did not
love thee would be lost to all appreciation of
the feline form divine. I love thee, Thomaso, oh,
how I love thee!’</p>

<p>“Of course, I blushed, my dear Fido—I knew
only too well how undeserving I was.</p>

<p>“But, to quote an old chestnut, the course of
true love was by no means smooth with me. It
chanced that the attic room of the house next
to the one in which my charmer lived, was occupied
by a young man named Jenkins. Now
that fellow Jenkins had the fool notion that he
was musical. That wouldn’t have been so bad,
though his singing was vile, but he wanted to
monopolize the singing business altogether. You
never saw such an envious brute! Just as soon
as I began my lovely serenades, that despicable
counter-jumper would begin throwing old boots
and chunks of coal at me. But I kept my temper
and said nothing, though I was mad enough to
claw the face off him.</p>

<p>“Not content with his vicious assaults, the
murderous brute finally attempted to assassinate
me, and very nearly succeeded. I had composed
a madrigal for my sweetheart, and had
just finished singing it to her one evening when
that calico-vending dude fired at me with a pistol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and narrowly missed cutting me off in the flower
of my youth. The ball lodged in my shoulder,
and gave me no end of trouble. Did you ever
hear of such a cold-blooded attempt to—”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Tommy,” said Fido, “but what
was the song like?”</p>

<p>“Let me see;” said Tommy, “perhaps I can
remember it. Oh yes, it ran like this:</p>

<p>“‘<i>When the silvery moon doth brightly beam,
after the toil of day is done, how fair my darling
dost thou seem, as thou climb’st the fence, or on
the ridge-pole swiftly run. Thy form is sylph-like
in its grace; thy voice seraphic sweet and low;
how soft the whiskers on thy face, that in the
moonbeams brightly glow.</i></p>

<p>“‘<i>Miow, miow, miow, miow, ’iow, ’iow, ’iow!</i>’”</p>

<p>“Um-ah,—” said Fido. “Your song has
one very admirable feature—it has but one
verse. I am not sure, however, but that I
shall have to acquit the young man who shot
you. Self defense, you know, my dear Tommy
is—”</p>

<p>“Oh, stow your sarcasm, Fido!” cried Tommy.
“It isn’t at all becoming to you, my boy.
If you don’t want to hear the rest of my story,
just say so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Tommy, you mustn’t be so sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
to the raillery of an old friend. Go on
with your yarn. It is highly interesting.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, the ball lodged in
my shoulder and nearly killed me. I was
sick a long time, and the doctor finally took
me to a veterinary for consultation. Of course
I couldn’t say anything about the bullet—on
the lady’s account you know—so the doctor
was stumped for once. The veterinary pounded
me black and blue from head to foot, and
after gouging my belly full of finger holes,
said—‘He’s got appendicitis, and we will
have to operate.’ That settled <em>me</em>—I just
jumped through the window, sash and all,
and weak as I was, succeeded in escaping.
A man who doesn’t know lead poisoning from
appendicitis, can’t monkey with Tommy Baker’s
domestic economy, you can just bet
your life on that!</p>

<p>“Through the kindly offices of one of my
friends I succeeded in getting accommodations
in a stable near by, where I lived on mice
and wind for three weeks, at the end of which
time my wound was entirely well. I had more
wind than mice on my stomach most of the
time, but the dieting evidently did me good.
I finally went home, and you never saw such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
rejoicing as there was among the children.
They hugged me ’most to death.</p>

<p>“The doctor was always kind to me, but
at times his attentions were quite marked.
He often kept me in a little room by myself
for days and days at a time. He fed me with
his own hand, and was very careful of my
health. He took my temperature and pulse,
and looked at my tongue twice a day. Sometimes
he put a little needle in my back and
seemed to be squirting something under the
skin. It didn’t hurt much, but I felt mighty
funny a little while afterward. Queer, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Fido, who had had diphtheria once and was
up on toxins, smiled rather pityingly and
said, dryly, “Rather.”</p>

<p>“I never doubted the doctor’s honesty of
purpose but once. There was a little room
just off the library that he called the laboratory.
He used to shut himself up in that little
closet—that’s about all it was—for hours at a
time. Now it wasn’t any of my business, but
I couldn’t help being curious to know what
he was doing in that little den. Then, too,
I was certain that I smelled nice fresh meat
just as he came out one day. Of course that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
completely demoralized me and I determined
to look into the matter. Ah me! why did I
not remember that old story about Bluebeard?</p>

<p>“Well, I watched my chance, and one night
when the doctor had his back turned I sneaked
into the laboratory, the door of which was
slightly ajar. Noticing that he had left the
door open, the doctor came back and closed
and locked it, leaving me a prisoner. I was not
frightened, however, for I was sure the doctor
would soon be at work in the laboratory again
and give me an opportunity to escape. I
chuckled to myself, wretch that I was, to
think that my curiosity was at last to be gratified.</p>

<p>“Jumping upon the table that the doctor
used as a work bench, I saw a sight that froze
the very whiskers on my cheeks! There,
spread out upon the table lay the ghastly,
mangled, lifeless body of a cat whom I recognized
as one of my best friends! I fell in a
dead faint.”</p>

<p>“Sort of a cataleptic fit—eh, Tommy?” said
Fido, with a sly, humorous twinkle in his eye.
Tommy disdained to answer, and continued:</p>

<p>“How long I lay in my swoon I do not know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
When I awoke, the doctor was standing over
me and <span class="locked">saying—</span></p>

<p>“‘I wonder how the devil that blamed cat
got in here! He seems to be sick.’</p>

<p>“Sick? Ye Gods! I should think I was
sick!</p>

<p>“I never became quite reconciled to the
doctor after that, and when, some time afterward,
he forbade the children to kiss and hug
me any more just because I ate some pickled
stuff that stood on a shelf in his office, I actually
grew to dislike him.</p>

<p>“But everybody else loved the doctor,
and I have sometimes thought that perhaps
I didn’t quite understand him. He was certainly
good and kind to everybody about him.</p>

<p>“Taken all in all, my life was a very happy
one, and I not only had a pleasant home, but
after a time I got a real jolly old chum, by the
name of Towser. When Johnny first brought
Towser home he ‘sicked’ him on me, ‘just for
fun,’ he said, and the old dog and I had a terrible
scrap. But I swiped him a good one
under the eye, I tell you, and he treated me
fine after that.”</p>

<p>“Scrap? Swiped him? Why, what on earth
do you mean, Tommy?” asked Fido.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
“Oh! I forgot that you were an aristocrat, my
dear Fido. I meant that I had a fight with Towser
and struck him under the eye. See?”</p>

<p>“Ah! now I comprehend,” replied Fido.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying,” continued Tommy,
“I enjoyed life immensely. Towser was a fine old
fellow, and he and I used to romp and play with
the children most of the time.”</p>

<p>“Your life must indeed have been very happy,
and I wonder that you could ever have left so
pleasant a home, friend Tommy,” said Fido.</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear old friend, there was never
dream of bliss so fair that no cloud e’er came to
mar the beauty of its skies. Trouble came to
that happy household, and within a few weeks
all was sadly changed, and I was again a waif of
the streets.</p>

<p>“The baby had been ailing for some time, and
we could see that the doctor was very uneasy
about him. The poor little fellow finally developed
some brain trouble or other—I can’t remember
the Latin name of it, but I believe it
was what old Dr. Cochran over at ‘The Corners,’
used to call ‘Water on the brain,’ or Meningeetus,’
or something like that.</p>

<p>“Well, the poor little fellow didn’t stand his
sickness very long. It was just awful to see him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
wasting away, getting weaker and weaker every
day. He used to notice me quite a little at first,
but after a while he didn’t seem to know me any
more. I had suspected this for a day or two, but
it seemed too horrible for belief. It was soon
plain, however, that dear little Harry no longer
recognized those who loved him, and for the
first time it dawned upon me that my darling
playmate was soon to be called away forever.
Baby dropped off to sleep one night, and the
doctor said that he thought the little one was
better. He deceived everybody but me—I had
seen babies go to sleep that way before, lots o’
times.</p>

<p>“As I feared, Harry never awoke again in
this world. I heard Ethel say the angels had
taken him away to Heaven—a grand, beautiful
place that human folks say is up yonder some
where beyond the clouds. If that was true, the
angels were mighty mean—for we were all
broken-hearted.</p>

<p>“If Ethel was right about Harry going to
Heaven, I hope there’s room for dogs and cats
up there. Poor old Towser fell sick and died
soon after the baby went, and I would feel better
about the little one’s death if I knew that Towser
was with him. The faithful old dog used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
take such good care of the dear little pet. Then,
too, I might see them again some day, and we
could live the old happy days over again. Don’t
mind my emotion, Fido, I loved Harry very
dearly. Bless my whiskers, old chap, if you are
not crying too!</p>

<p>“After they had put our sweet little blossom
into a cruel white, frosted looking box and taken
him away, the house seemed as gloomy as an old
cellar. Nobody ever seemed to be happy again.
Ethel and Johnny mourned after little Harry
all the time, and many a time I caught the doctor
crying softly to himself when he thought no
one was looking. He didn’t think I understood,
poor fellow.</p>

<p>“The doctor appeared to be more like his old
self again, after a time, but he seemed to work
harder than ever before. He sat up very late o’
nights reading and writing—that is, when he had
no patients to attend to. My! how he used to
slave over those people! And half of ’em never
paid their bills, either. The doctor didn’t mind
the poor ones, but he used to say that ‘God’s
patients’ never gave him half so much trouble
as ‘the devil’s patients.’ Sometimes I half suspected
that the doctor was working hard just to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
get little Harry off his mind, but perhaps I was
not a good judge of such things.</p>

<p>“Well, a man is not a horse; he can’t carry a
big load very long without breaking down, and
the doctor soon showed signs of exhaustion. It
grieved me to see him going to pieces, but I was
helpless. I felt that it would be a very delicate
matter to even attempt to advise him. And so
I was obliged to watch my unfortunate master
dying by inches before my very eyes.</p>

<p>“The end was not long delayed. The doctor
finally contracted an attack of that new-fangled
disease—let me see, what do they call it? Oh
yes, ‘La Grippe.’ Instead of going to bed, as he
should have done, he slopped about in all sorts
of weather until he got pneumonia. It was all
up with my poor master then—he died within
a week.</p>

<p>“I had always supposed that doctors were all
rich men, until I lived with one. My master left
a lot of bad accounts and a little life insurance;
that was all. Why, his wife even had to sell his
books and instruments to defray his funeral expenses.</p>

<p>“After the doctor died, everything was changed.
The end of my happy home-life was not far
distant. The children were sent away to boarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
school after a while, and their mamma soon
went to live at a fashionable hotel. The home
was completely broken up. I can’t tell you how
bad I felt when I saw all the furniture and things
that the doctor used to prize so highly hauled
away to be sold.</p>

<p>“Heigho! ‘How soon we are forgot,’ as old
Rip Van Winkle so truly said. Well, I soon found
myself homeless and a vagabond once more. I
have since had all sorts of luck—mostly bad,
however. I have tried my hand at almost everything,
but have never been able to secure another
comfortable position. I was a lawyer’s cat
for a while, but my family pride came to my
rescue after a time, and I quit the job. There is
blue blood in my veins, Fido, and though I may
be down on my luck, I have not quite lost my
self-respect.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you are boasting of blue blood nowadays,
are you, Tommy? How does that happen?” asked
Fido.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know about the cats that
were found in the pyramids along with Rameses
and his folks?” asked Tommy. “You ought to
read up, my dear Fido.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard from the doctor’s folks
since their home was broken up?” asked Fido.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
“Oh, yes; I have kept track of them right
along. The doctor’s wife finally married again
and the children came home to live with her
soon afterward. I called at their house one
night, and was unceremoniously kicked out.
Johnny and Ethel were grown-up folks and had
no use for cats any more, besides, they didn’t
know me from Adam. I was just a tramp cat,
that was all, and was treated like any other
vagrant.</p>

<p>“But I have got used to hard lines, and so
long as I can capture an occasional rat, I suppose
I will be able to live. Once in a while a nice pet
canary or toothsome young chicken comes my
way; then there is great joy in the department
of the interior.</p>

<p>“My health is none of the best, at times, and
I don’t believe I shall live many years, but the
sooner to sleep the sooner to rest, and I know
that brave old Towser and dear little Harry are
waiting for me up yonder. Towser is still a loyal
old dog, and Harry is not grown-up folks, like
Johnny and Ethel, but a sweet, winsome little
baby boy as of old.</p>

<p>“Well, Fido, old comrade, I have told you
my story, and it is now nearly midnight, so we
must say good night. There is nobody to complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
when <em>I</em> keep late hours, but it’s different
with you. Good jobs are scarce, and I don’t
want you to risk losing yours. I will see you
next Tuesday evening if you like.</p>

<p>“Hello! it’s raining. There’s a cold wind
blowing too. Awful weather for the rheumatism
and mange, isn’t it? You’ll get that pretty
blanket wet, Fido, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, drat the blanket!” said Fido, “I’ll hurry
along though. Good night, Tommy.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Fido, good night.”</p>

<h2 id="JOHNNY">JOHNNY<br />

<span class="subhead">A STORY OF THE PHILIPPINES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Johnny was a typic gamin from the Chicago
slums. He never denied it, and it would have
been useless if he had; the ear marks were too
plain. What had impelled him to enter the
volunteer service was a mystery. Some of the
men in the —th Illinois had been heard to say
at the company mess, that a difference of opinion
upon matters ethical between Johnny and
the police was the main-spring that had worked
the little tough army-ward. Pertinent inquiries
directed at the boy himself had ceased abruptly
when big Tom O’Brien, the battalion sergeant
major, got through swearing, and rubbing the
bump on his head with which Johnny, through
the medium of an accurately aimed canteen, had
decorated him. Tom wound up with, “Byes, the
little divil is too small to lick, an’ too big to
monkey wid, so I’ll sarve yez notice that Mr. T.
O’Brien, Esq. will attind to his own business
hereafter. An’ be Jasus,” he added significantly,
“the rist av ye’ll do the same, for be the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
token, I notice yez all be bigger than Johnny.”
It was obvious that the boy did not need a
protector, but nevertheless, the warm-hearted
Irishman’s attitude toward him was a peace promoter
in no mean degree.</p>

<p>No one had ever accused Johnny of patriotism.
He knew all about the blowing up of the
Maine and thought it was a shabby piece of
business, the perpetrators of which should be
punished. “But,” he added sagely, “they ain’t
hangin’ none o’ them strikin’ railroad guys, fer
wreckin’ trains and sluggin’ scabs, an’ I guess
there ain’t much difference. There’s a lot o’
dead an’ smashed up folks, any way you fix it.”</p>

<p>It was evidently a hopeless task to try and
elucidate for Johnny patriotic reasons for the
war with Spain. His philosophy was too strong
to cope with.</p>

<p>When Johnny first joined the regiment he
was not a creditable specimen from a physical
standpoint. A subtle sympathy with the under
dog in the breast of the regimental surgeon,
Major Brice, was mainly responsible for the
mustering in of the unpromising recruit. Slouchy
in gait, under-sized, weazened, lanky and round
shouldered, with the air of one pursued, the boy
was as unsoldier-like as could possibly be imagined.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
He said he was nineteen, but it did not
require a professional eye to detect the fraud—a
fraud of several years—without much doubt.</p>

<p>The captain of K Company was very particular
about the physique of his men, and the
surgeon and he had a confidential arrangement
which had kept out of the service many a man
who might have passed a fair examination
before the army board. When Captain Harkins
saw Johnny in the ranks of the “rookies,” he
gave a gasp of horror and ran post haste to the
surgeon’s quarters. He entered the tent rather
unceremoniously, somewhat ruffling the self-composure
of its occupant, who was rather
austere and dignified at times.</p>

<p>“Ah, Captain,” said the surgeon, “what’s the
trouble, somebody hurt?”</p>

<p>“Hurt!” exclaimed the captain, “Hurt! Great
Scott! I’m paralyzed. How in Heaven’s name
did you ever pass that little degenerate shrimp
of a gutter snipe that came in with that last
batch of rookies? Is this a practical joke?”</p>

<p>“I never make practical jokes,” replied the
surgeon, serenely. “I had a little whim of my
own to gratify. Didn’t know I was whimsical,
did you? Well, I am, and that boy is my latest
whim. I fancied the service would be better for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
him than the jail. I had him assigned to your
company—well, because you and I understand
each other pretty well, and because I want him
myself. Just reassign him to me for special
duty, and I’ll do the rest.”</p>

<p>The captain roared. “Well,” he said, when
he had caught his breath, “you have perpetrated
a practical joke all the same, and landed
good and proper. You had me well nigh scared
into a fit.”</p>

<p>Johnny, inscribed in regulation form as John
Blank, on the muster roll of K. Company, was
formally assigned to duty in the hospital department,
and the following morning found him
standing at the door of the surgeon’s tent, a
full-fledged orderly, with a rudely extemporized
cross of red flannel upon the arm of his “big
brother” blouse. There was a little quiet snickering
at the surgeon’s expense, but this soon
died out, for the man of saws and pills was
sensitive, somewhat muscular and, above all,
wore the maple leaf on his shoulder straps.</p>

<p>The colonel was very indulgent with the surgeon;
he knew his failings, and when his eyes
fell upon the new orderly, he smilingly remarked
to the adjutant, “I hope the major will be able
to raise that slummy looking chap to be a soldier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
but I’m afraid he has a big contract on his
hands.”</p>

<p>But the surgeon was a practical humanitarian
who believed in a physical basis of things moral.
He had a hobby, as the new recruit soon
discovered. Johnny was daily put through
a course of physical “stunts” that made his
life something more than a glad, sweet song.
He was a little rebellious at first, and his instructor
had hard work to keep him from deserting.
Through the connivance of the colonel,
however, who had the boy brought before
him after some very flagrant act of insubordination
and depicted to him in vivid
colors a vision of an early morning firing squad,
Johnny was brought back into line again and
went on with his stunts. He was just a little
suspicious of the “Old Man’s” seriousness, but
after the major had informed him that the
colonel was a man of great earnestness of purpose
and absolutely devoid of regard for human
life—blood-thirsty, in fact—he became in a measure
reconciled to what at first seemed to him
a hard lot.</p>

<p>But as Johnny’s training proceeded, he was
conscious of a new and unwonted interest in
life. He began to have a sense of physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
strength, and felt an increase of energy that
made his course of physical training pleasurable.
His shoulders were beginning to set up and
back. It was no longer necessary to either
drive or coax him to his task of self-development.
The surgeon was meanwhile devoting
such time as he could steal from his daily
routine of antidoting the endeavors of the
government to prepare our soldiers for Cuba
by killing them in Tampa, to stimulation of
the mental side of the neglected boy of the
streets. Johnny had innate capacity enough
but, as the major said, he had never in his
whole life had any healthy blood to feed his
brain, hence the development of the latter was
not possible until now.</p>

<p>The men of the regiment scarcely appreciated
the gradual change in Johnny. He unfolded
just as a plant unfolds. Growth was
there, steadily going on. The major knew,
and the colonel remarked upon it, but the
rest did not comprehend until one day the
street boy stripped to the buff and, urged on by
the mock encouragement of some of the privates,
entered an improvised ring for a “friendly”
contest with an ex-professlonal, who had
entered the service chiefly in search of novelty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
in the way of recreation. When the affair was
over with, and the amateur referee had finished
the rather prolonged count over Johnny’s opponent,
Tom O’Brien said delightedly; “Begorra,
the byes didn’t get a run fer their money.
Yez kin all poke fun at Johnny now, an’ ask
him all the sassy quistions ye loike, an’ divil
a wurrud’ll I say to yez, unless yez go in
more than wan at a toime.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Johnny had become
soldierly timber, and it was not long before
the captains vied with each other in coaxing
him to apply for a transfer to their companies.
Captain Harkins alone refrained from urging
the boy to return to the ranks. He might
simply have assigned him back to company
duty, but as he remarked to the colonel, he
felt that “Johnny belonged to the man who
had made a soldier out of him.”</p>

<p>The major was not ignorant of the change
in sentiment regarding his protegé. Desiring
to be fair with him he said, “Johnny,
some of the officers are beginning to think
a little better of you than they used to. Captain
Harkins is entitled to you, but seems
to think you ought to have a chance to use
your own discretion in the matter of going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
back to the ranks. Taking care of my horse
and tent, and rolling bandages for me is possibly
not so much to your liking as being a
real, fighting soldier. We shall probably go
to the front soon. The war isn’t over yet,
and they can’t keep us in Florida forever,
so we are likely to see some pretty hot times
in Cuba. If you want to go back to the company
just say the word, and back you shall
go.”</p>

<p>Johnny stood at the door of the major’s
tent for a moment looking at the gorgeous
southern sky. When he turned toward his
patron his eyes were wet.</p>

<p>“Did you think I’d do that, sir?”</p>

<p>And the major replied, “No, Johnny, I didn’t
think you would.”</p>

<p>But the war did end very soon, and the
pride of the Brigade, the —th Illinois,—athletes,
every mother’s son of them,—did not
get out of Florida and into Cuba until there
was nothing remaining to be done save policing
that fair and unfortunate island. As
soon as orders came to leave for Cuba, Major
Brice tendered his resignation, intending to
return to civil life and resume his practice.
Johnny was disconsolate. Police duty in Cuba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
was not an inviting prospect—he recalled that
he never did like the policeman or his works,
on principle. Chicago had no attraction for
him. He had been born in the army. His
previous existence, he said, “didn’t count.”
He had begun life in the major’s tent, and
when that tent came down there would be
no longer home life for him. The major was
deeply touched by his protegé’s devotion, and,
quite alive to the fact that Johnny would
be a pretty helpless member of any society
but the army, interested the brigade commander,
who had been assigned for duty in
the Philippines, in his case.</p>

<p>Through the combined influence of the general
and the major, the boy received his discharge,
and was immediately reenlisted in the
—th Montana, then preparing to start for
Manila. The bluff old general said: “Everything’s
over in Cuba, but I suspect that nothing’s
begun in the Philippines; In my opinion,
h—l’s brewing in Manila, and unless my experience
in fighting Indians is worthless, I feel
pretty safe in saying that those d—d brown-skinned
fellows out yonder are going to give
your Uncle Samuel a devil of a lot of trouble
before we get through with ’em. Dewey didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
do a thing to us, not to the Spaniards, when he
took Manila. That Montana regiment is as
liable to get into a mix up as any of ’em—they’re
scrappers all right—and it’s just as well
for that orderly of yours to get in on the ground
floor. But, Major, will he fight?”</p>

<p>The major’s eyes twinkled as he replied,
“Don’t worry yourself about Johnny, my dear
General. He’ll give a good account of himself.
He is a good soldier by profession, even though
I could never cure him of profanity nor teach
him what patriotism means. He regards fighting
as a vocation, but believes in attending to it
for all he is worth.”</p>

<p>As the general had said, trouble had not yet
begun in the Philippines. It came soon enough,
and Johnny got in on the ground floor with a
vengeance. When the fighting finally began he
was, to use his own vernacular, “on the spot,”
which fact, as he jestingly remarked, gave him
for the first time the privilege of enjoying “the
luxury of more name than ‘Johnny’.” His comrades
exclaimed, apropos of his new cognomen,
“Holy smoke! how it fits.”</p>

<p>The —th Montana had its troubles out there
in those tropic isles. Few realize what it means
to plunge a raw volunteer regiment from a temperate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
climate into tropic wilds infested with
a foe that recognizes no rule in warfare save
implacable, relentless murder of the enemy, by
hook or by crook, by fair means or foul. A foe
that fights manfully and fairly, whether at
long range or close quarters, is bad enough for
“raw ones” to face, even though they be the
best in the world—the which is stenographic
for American boys.</p>

<p>Bullets and bayonets are integral parts of
the soldier’s life. Familiarity breeds contempt
for these—they are his own tools, the tools with
which he blazes his own road to glory or to a
hero’s death. But those terrible bolos, and the
Moro swords—those cruel knives that shear a
man from crown to waist, or lop off heads or
limbs as though they were chalk, wielded by
little brown fiends who care naught for rules
of fence and are willing to mix it when you
compel them to close with you, just as a rat
will set his fangs in your flesh when you
corner him—they are different, quite. And
when your soldier boy thinks of the newspapers
that are preaching the milk of human kindness
at home and watching like so many harpies
for the slightest mishap from which political
capital may be made, whilst he is wallowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
in the blood of comrades upon whom nameless
mutilations have been inflicted, he has hard
work to keep his courage up to the fighting
pitch.</p>

<p>Then the dread plasmodium-bearing mosquito
of the swamps, with its trail of death dealing
chill and hemorrhage, the hellish amœba of the
foul tropic streams, that are so often the soldier’s
only source of water supply, and that awful
typhoid, hovering like a somber-hued, gigantic
bat over an army camp—selecting as its victims
the very flower of the soldiery—these be things,
not of glory, but of death, with no sublimity
save that of noble self-sacrifice. And that
dreadful nostalgia, that sickening yearning for
home, which so often kills, or, aided by the
pitiless torrid sun, beating down upon devoted
heads unused to a foretaste of hell, sends men
with brains awry back to Frisco by the ship
load. Were not these terrors an awful crucible
in which to try the metal of men whom their
friends, at home, who do not know gold when
they see it, are wont to call “tin soldiers?”</p>

<p>What a lot of maudlin sentiment the home
papers and builders of political issues lavished
upon those Filipino fiends who, it was alleged,
were given more water than was good for them!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
The soldier at the front knew the mockery of
it all. He had felt the bolo of the treacherous
“amigo” at his back, the while he parleyed,
friendly-wise, with the aforesaid amigo’s snaky
comrade in front. He had seen the pitiful remnant
of what were once white human forms,
the forms of his own comrades and friends,
still living, perhaps, fresh from the torturings
inflicted by their savage captors. He had seen
the dismembered bodies of children and old
men who had been slain in cold blood because
they or their friends had been friendly to the
Americans, and he had heard the wailing of
women who had suffered shameful outrage,
aye, a living death, at the hands of our “little
brown brother.” What wonder that the boy
in khaki grew tired of making prisoners of
fiends from hell, who deserved nothing better
than a short shrift and a merry trip back to
their father, the devil, and drove his bayonet
a little deeper or emptied his magazine a bit
faster than would permit him to see or heed a
signal of surrender?</p>

<p>Of all the regiments who were sent to those
far away islands, none bore itself more gallantly,
none was more pertinaciously put to the fore
than the —th Montana. A history of the thin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
khaki-clad firing line in the Philippines that
did not give more than a modest share of
honor to that gallant regiment would be but
a false and biased chronicle.</p>

<p>Johnny, the boy of the slums, may not have
been so patriotically inspired as some of his
comrades, but he was a fighter by instinct, and
a soldier by profession. He knew his duty, fear
was a thing apart from him, and he attended
strictly to “business” as he understood it,
namely, to obeying orders, shooting true, and
keeping tab of the Filipinos he potted. There
be those who say that his game bags were not
only large, but of select contents. He had a keen
eye for brown officers, and, as he said, there
were so many Filipino generals and such folk,
that there were enough for everybody, even
after he had taken his multitudinous pick.</p>

<p>It was not long before the mighty ones at
staff headquarters became quite familiar with
Johnny’s ways. Our soldier soon found himself
in demand, a demand which, from details of
special and hazardous duty, occasional at first,
but finally very frequent, won for him a sergeant’s
stripes, and regrets at headquarters that
it was not possible to immediately decorate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
his shoulders with strap and bar. Never did better
man wear non-com’s stripes.</p>

<p>The sergeant is the pivot around which, as
upon an axis, revolves the discipline and efficiency
of the rank and file. He is the key-stone
of both the individual and company arch of
courage. Johnny was all that a disciplinarian
should be, and more, he was idolized by the men.
Twice was he wounded by a ball that smashed
several ribs and narrowly missed taking out so
much of his chest wall that, as he said, his heart
and lungs would have been subject to indecent
exposure. Again did the little “brown bellies”
get him,—with a bolo this time. But Johnny’s
bayonet was a fraction of a second too quick for
the luckless Filipino who wielded the “chopper”
and the heavy blade missed the vitals by a hair.
A siege of typhoid followed, but Johnny said,
when the surgeon wanted to have him sick-leaved
home. “Hell! no. It wouldn’t be business,
an’ besides, I’m at home now—anyhow,
as near as I’ll ever be. Shootin’, cuttin’ and
typhoid never was calculated to kill gutter
snipes, an’ so long as I keep away from water,
which is the only thing that I hain’t tried, I
reckon I’ll pull through. Then there’s old Miss
Krag, here,” and he tenderly patted his rifle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
“she can’t get any furlough, cause she hain’t
had any pluggin’ or boloin’, or fever, an’ she’d
be lonesome.” And so Johnny stayed at the
front, and shot Filipinos, swore great oaths
and—got well.</p>

<p>The Filipinos were “pacified,” so all the home
papers said, save those few that were politically
favorable to the democratic “outs” and
opposed to the republican “ins.” A few boloed
soldiers or native women and children were not
evidences of war, they were mere “local disturbances,
occasional manifestations of unrest,
etc.” The men at the front and the friendly
brown ones thought differently, but who cares
what the pig under the knife thinks? Uncle Sam
didn’t seem quite so certain of himself as the
papers would have us believe he was. Whilst
egging the eagle on to scream peans of victory
as a soothing embrocation for such as might be
restive under the war tax, he kept his weather
eye open just the same. To clinch the matter
of pacification, troops were ordered here and
there into the towns adjacent to the swamps
and rocky fastnesses where lurked the more
troublesome of the ladrones. Small detachments
were often sent, much smaller in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
instances than was safe, as the government
learned to its sorrow.</p>

<p>Much of the outpost duty fell upon the —th
Montana. K company was ordered to duty in
the province of Zambales, island of Luzon, and
took up its quarters at Poombato, a place which
could be called a town by courtesy only. It
was nothing more than a handful of palm
thatched huts, inhabited chiefly by old men,
women and children who couldn’t become enrolled
with their “pacified” brethren who, bolo
in hand, were lurking in the neighboring
hills and thickets, awaiting a chance for a sudden
dash upon the enemy and a merry boloing in
the camp of the Americanos. The men of K
company were no “kickers,” as they were wont
to express it, but the idea of rotting in the
wilds while trying to protect a few miserable
natives from possible outlaws who were their
own kith and kin, and with whom the protected
ones kept in pretty close and friendly
touch, was not the pleasantest.</p>

<p>The men of K company knew the Filipino—knew
him root and branch—they had fought
him long enough, the Lord knows, and had
discovered that caution was the price of sound
throats. Their commander, Captain Benning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
was ever a discreet officer and careful of his
men, above all he knew that somewhere in the
vicinity hovered the worst of all the brigands
and cut throats the Philippines had yet produced,
“Captain” Agramonte, but the deadly
monotony of their daily duties was more than
the men could stand. Despite warnings and, it
must be confessed, not infrequently despite
strict orders, the men would stray away into
the jungle, often in quest of a scrap with stray
Filipinos, sometimes seeking such excitement as
shooting wild game affords. These little excursions
were apparently safe enough at first. No
accidents happening, however, the men grew
bolder, and roamed about almost at will,
and then the trouble came. Man after man
was found boloed, or disappeared as if the
earth had swallowed him up. On one occasion
a small searching party, in quest of a
missing comrade, was ambushed and narrowly
escaped annihilation. Captain Benning was
not left long in doubt as to whom he was
indebted for the loss of his men. The ghastly,
recently severed head of one of his men was
hurled from the brake one night into camp,
rolling, as chance would have it, its bloody
way to the very door of the captain’s own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
tent. Affixed to the awful thing was a scurrilous
note signed, “Agramonte.”</p>

<p>Captain Benning was a brave officer, with
just enough revenge corpuscles in his blood to
make the possession of Agramonte’s person
the one thing in all the world to be desired.
This last atrocity was more than he could endure.
Agramonte’s life he must and would
have. He knew well enough that there was
but one way to kill or capture the outlaw.
Having but one company at his command he
could not well send a large party against the
enemy. Indeed, the entire company was
scarcely large enough to make a punitive expedition
safe. Whatever was done must of
necessity be done by strategy, and by a small
party. A set plan was impossible. What was
wanted was a “man,” and the captain thought
that he knew where to find him. Turning to
his orderly he said, “Tell Sergeant Blank that I
want him to report to me at once.”</p>

<p>Johnny promptly appeared at the captain’s
quarters and stood respectfully at attention,
awaiting his commander’s pleasure.</p>

<p>“Sergeant,” said the captain, pointing to
the outlaw’s grim token of defiance, “do you
know Agramonte when you see him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
“I think I do, sir,” replied Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well, Sergeant, I want him, and I want
him badly. If anybody can get him, you can.
You have done plenty of scouting. What do
you think about it?”</p>

<p>Johnny glanced at the gory head of his
comrade, lying at the captain’s feet, and his
jaws set ominously. He answered through his
teeth:</p>

<p>“I think I’ll get him sir, or he’ll get me.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said the captain, “go
after him, and be sure you get him.”</p>

<p>“Alive, sir?”</p>

<p>“Alive if you can; I wish to make an example
of him, for the benefit of those cut-throats
of his, but don’t take a chance of losing
him. I want to see him at my tent door,
and a few holes more or less in his miserable
carcass will not mar his beauty much in my
eyes.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir; any instructions?”</p>

<p>“None whatever, Sergeant, except to get
him, get him sure and as quick as the Lord’ll
let you.”</p>

<p>The captain rose, and with a total disregard
of military etiquette held out his hand and
said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
“Good luck to you Johnny, and don’t forget
that you are worth more to me than that
d—d renegade. If you don’t land him, be
sure to bring yourself back. We are old
comrades, you know.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother your head about me, Captain,”
replied Johnny, his eyes glistening,
as he grasped his commander’s hand; “I’ll
come back all right, and I’ll bring that d—d
renegade with me. We may neither of us be
pretty to look at when we drop in on you,
but you can bet we’ll get here together,”
and Johnny disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>An army scout travels “light” and when
he is about to set out on an expedition, his
preparations are a marvel of speed and simplicity.
Johnny was even speedier than usual
in getting ready for his perilous mission.
He had little to do save to strap on a brace of
navies, his canteen and haversack and say
goodbye to his “bunky.” The latter, as his
friend was leaving, handed him an enormous
bowie knife, saying, “Here’s a western lancet
that I want you to take with you, just for
luck. We like ’em out our way. They don’t
miss fire, nor go off half cocked, and they can’t
be beat for tickling the solar plexus.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
bunky forgot to mention the bowie’s chief
merit, that it wasn’t noisy. This was left
for Johnny’s own exploitation.</p>

<p>Johnny loosened his belt, slipped the bowie
upon it and said, “Thanks, and speakin’ of
the West reminds me of a little trick one of
the boys taught me when we was cooped up
in Manila. I almost forgot this,” and reaching
up he took down a coil of rope that hung
at the side of the tent. This he slung over
his shoulder, sash-wise.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour after his interview
with his captain, our soldier slipped through
the picket lines and plunged into the jungle.
He knew that he must get beyond the outskirts
of the town under cover of darkness if
he would elude the watchful eyes of the Filipinos
who hung about in the surrounding hills
and jungles. Had he not started before dawn
it would have been necessary to await the
coming of the next night, in order to leave the
camp unobserved by the enemy.</p>

<p>Agramonte’s base of operation was so well
known that the uninitiated may naturally
wonder why he had not been captured long
before. It requires only a moderate knowledge
of the native character and of the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the country to understand why Captain Benning
with the small force at his command,
had hitherto refrained from attempts at the
outlaw’s capture. A formal campaign against
him would have necessitated beating up the
Filipinos precisely as game is beaten up in
a battue. This would have required a very
large and powerful force. Agramonte, fully
cognizant of the situation, had established himself
at Masillo, a little village in the foot hills
less than five miles from the camp of the
Americans, where he conducted himself precisely
as if there was no such thing existing
as the United States of America or a hostile
army. The Batolan river lay between him
and his enemies in khaki. This was a turbulent
mountain stream of considerable width,
with no ford nearer than some seven or eight
miles from the renegade’s headquarters. Granting
that his enemies succeeded in crossing the
stream, which was not an easy thing for a
small force such as he believed would probably
be sent against him to do under fire, he had
but to hide himself amid his native rocks and
ravines and he could snap his brown fingers at
the hated Americanos.</p>

<p>Knowing the outlaw’s lair, and the character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of the country, Johnny had evolved his plans
of campaign before leaving camp, while he was
hastily preparing for the expedition. From
his experience in scouting expeditions he knew
that the only way to succeed in his mission
was to beat the Filipino chief at his own game,
by taking him completely by surprise at such
time as he might be found separated from his
companion ladrones. The lariat which Johnny
had slung over his shoulder was perhaps
the most methodic and pertinent of his preparations.</p>

<p>Travelling through the Luzon brake is neither
easy nor comfortable, even in broad daylight,
but at night it is practically impossible
to the inexperienced traveller. But Johnny
was no novice at the business in which he was
engaged, and seemed to instinctively know
the weak spots in the wild tangle of trees and
brake. He was apprised from time to time
that he was an intruder in the jungle. Troops
of monkeys chattered at him saucily as they
swung down from limb to limb of the trees
to get a nearer view of the strange object that
had disturbed their sleep. Having seen him,
they screamed affrighted warnings to the other
jungle folk and fled back to the topmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
boughs, there to hurl defiant challenges at
the intruder. Enormous bats beat their foul
wings fiercely against his face as he toiled on,
their whizzing, whirling flight sending the
heavy, strangely perfumed night mist of the
tropic wood pulsing against his face in dank
waves. Once, as he crept through the brake,
almost on his hands and knees, he nearly fell
face down upon a huge creature of some kind.
Johnny never knew the nature of it, for startled
as he was, the beast was more so. It
sprang up with a frightened yelp and crashed
off through the jungle, snarling back at the
strange thing that had roused him from his
peaceful slumbers.</p>

<p>Again, as our soldier, breathing more freely
as he emerged from the brake into the open,
was skirting a little glade in the forest, a monster
serpent dangling its death dealing loops
downward from a bough struck him fairly upon
the chest, with a resounding whack that almost
knocked the breath out of him. A man
less nervy and experienced would have been
entangled in the cruel coils of the gigantic reptile,
but with a quick push of his powerful arm
against the cold, clammy folds of the awful
thing and a cat-like spring aside he was free.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Courageous as he was, this encounter made
his flesh creep. But none the less, he saw a
ludicrous side to the incident, and muttered
to himself, “Major Brice used to say somethin’
to me about the early bird catchin’ the worm.
I’m the early bird, all right, all right, but that
worm’s a little too big for Johnny’s craw.
Wonder what the dear old major’d think
o’ that chap, anyhow. I suppose he’d like to
bottle him.”</p>

<p>And there were other things, less pretentious
relatives of the giant snake who so nearly
did for Johnny. As his feet stumbled on
through the luxuriant tangle of tropic weeds
and grasses, he heard certain rustlings and
hissings that warned him of the nearness of
reptiles of lesser bulk, whose fangs were carriers
of liquid death, relentless and sudden, yet
slow enough for the victim to suffer the agonies
of the damned ere he died.</p>

<p>But Johnny pulled through the night without
mishap and, worn and haggard, as morning
dawned, he found himself upon the banks
of the Batolan. Here he knew he must stop
until nightfall. A white man’s head bobbing
up and down in the stream would have made
too good a target for even Filipino marksmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
wretched shots though they are, to miss at
such easy range. It would have been suicidal
to attempt to swim the river in broad day
light, besides, at that point the current was
too swift for a tired man to breast. Johnny
was nearly exhausted, so after a bite from the
small store in his haversack and a pull at his
canteen he laid down amid the bamboos that
fringed the river bank to await nightfall with
what patience he could.</p>

<p>Tired as Johnny was, he did not dare sleep.
The day was excessively warm and it was not
easy to keep awake, but under the stimulus of
several parties of Filipinos of whom he caught
a glimpse at various times as they passed to
and fro on the hill sides upon the opposite side
of the stream, he managed to fight off the
drowsiness with which his fatigue and the tropic
heat combined to overpower him. He did not
dare to even light his pipe, the soldier’s consolation,
lest he attract the attention of the enemy,
and with nothing to help him while away the
hours the day seemed almost interminable.</p>

<p>But the fiercely glowing red ball of the sun
finally sank behind the hills to westward, and
the tropic twilight mist began to rise from
brake and stream. Not far from the bank opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the spot where Johnny lay concealed,
he noted through the gathering shadows the
twinkle of lights upon the opposite hillside and
the glow of what appeared to be a camp fire,
and said to himself, “I reckon that must be
Masillo, an’ if it is I’m pretty close to that
d—d brown belly’s headquarters. It won’t do
to let him see me first. We hain’t been introduced
and he might cut me.”</p>

<p>Rising to his feet and pulling himself together,
“just to get the kinks out,” Johnny crept cautiously
through the brake up stream, with the
intention of crossing at a point which would
be safer from detection by the enemy. He had
traversed the river bank about a mile, when he
noticed that the river had widened out considerably
and was dotted here and there by a
number of broad, low lying, bamboo covered
islands, their outlines being clearly discernible
in the light of the gorgeous moon which was just
rising. “This ought to be a good place to get
across,” he thought. “I’m likely to find bottom
part of the way, an’ the walkin’ must be purty
fair on them islands.”</p>

<p>Divesting himself of all his clothing and
accouterments save his belt and lariat, Johnny
rolled his effects into as compact a form as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
and with his bundle under his arm waded
out toward the nearest island. The water rose
only to his waist, and although it was hard to
keep his footing in the swift running current,
he was not long in reaching his destination.
The brake was so dense upon the island that
he found it easier to traverse its lower shore
to the opposite side. Between the first island
and the next one, a little further down stream,
the water was deeper and swifter than before,
and our soldier had to swim for it. When he
reached the second island he was pretty well
blown and was compelled to take a breathing
spell. From the second island to the opposite
bank the water was very shallow and easily
forded, a circumstance of which, as the sequel
proved, the Filipinos themselves were fully cognizant,
and of which they had showed their
appreciation by stationing a reception committee
for possible invaders at that point.</p>

<p>Johnny clambered up the bank and pausing in
a diminutive clearing near the water, proceeded
to leisurely dress himself. He was just stooping
to lace his leggings when two forms sprang upon
him from the brake, one of them landing upon
his back. As he went down under the sudden
rush, he was dimly conscious of a heavy cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
blow upon his head. As he struggled with his
foes he felt the hot blood streaming down
from his temple and into his eyes. He managed
to turn face upward as the Filipino bore
him to the earth, but for a few seconds he
could do no more than grip his man tightly by
the body and prevent his striking him with the
bolo with which he was armed. The other Filipino
tried frantically to land a blow upon the
Americano, but without success, as his comrade
was most persistently and unwillingly in the
way. As soon as his wits returned Johnny,
suddenly letting go of his adversary’s body,
got a strangle hold on the Filipino’s throat
with his left arm, while with his right hand he
drew his bowie. Two quick jabs with the knife,
and the soldier knew that this part of the drama
was over. Practiced wrestler that he was, it
was an easy matter to slip from under the limp
body, and spring to his feet and bound away
to the edge of the little clearing.</p>

<div id="ip_143" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="399" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="captionl">“JOHNNY GOT A STRANGLE HOLD ON THE FILIPINO’S
THROAT WITH HIS LEFT HAND, WHILE WITH
HIS RIGHT HE DREW HIS KNIFE”</div></div>

<p>Running away was farthest from Johnny’s
mind. He wheeled about and faced the second
Filipino who, having recovered from his astonishment
at the denouement of the struggle in
which he had taken a subordinate part, rushed
toward the soldier, swinging his terrible bolo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
with the evident intention of bisecting him
post haste. Johnny, nothing loth, awaited the
rush, bowie in hand, as calmly as if he were on
parade. And then came a dodging and cutting
match that was as unfair as a two foot bolo
wielded by an uninjured Filipino, opposed to
a ten inch blade in the hands of a wounded
soldier could make it. But Johnny was an
athlete, and his pugilistic training was not lost
in such a contest.</p>

<p>In the first mad rush of his foe Johnny was
very nearly done for. As he sidestepped to
avoid the heavy Filipino blade, his foot slipped
and he nearly fell. The weapon missed his head
but inflicted a severe wound upon his right
shoulder, crippling for the moment his sword
arm. Feeling himself growing faint, he soon
determined to mix matters with his opponent
who, after missing his stroke, had sprung back
preparatory to another rush. As the Filipino
closed in with a vicious sweep at his enemy’s
head, Johnny transferred his knife to his left
hand and suddenly ducked under the descending
blade squarely into the arms of the Filipino,
who instinctively grappled with him, and forever
lost the opportunity of using his own
weapon. One short-arm swing of the bowie and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the Filipino, cut through the chest, hung limp in
the soldier’s arms. The weight of his foe bore
Johnny to the ground, where he lost consciousness,
the two combatants lying locked together
like two wild beasts that had fought each other
to the death.</p>

<p>All through the night the two men lay motionless
upon the ground, to all appearances
lifeless. Meanwhile a storm blew up and just as
the morning dawned the rain fell in torrents.
Johnny had merely fainted from loss of blood,
and the cool raindrops beating upon his face
revived him. At first, as he became conscious,
he had no clear conception of where he was or
of what had happened. He had a hazy recollection
of a struggle, but not the slightest notion
of what it was all about nor with whom or how
many he had fought. As his mind gradually recovered
itself, however, he remembered all the
details of the battle in which, as he now discovered,
he had been victorious. Disengaging
himself from the body of his late antagonist, he
rolled and crawled away a little distance, and
finally sat up and looked about the arena in
which they had battled.</p>

<p>The Filipino who had first attacked the
soldier lay a little distance away, stark dead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
The other, however, was still living. As Johnny
looked in his direction the body moved unmistakably
with a slight convulsive movement
of the chest, and a faint groan escaped the lips.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Johnny, “my friend over there
seems pretty lively for a corpse. Sorry I didn’t
cut just right. I’d have saved Uncle Sam and
Sergeant Blank a lot o’ trouble. I s’pose I’d
orter fix the d—d cuss up, story book style, but
charity begins at home, and it’s me for first
crack at the aid package.”</p>

<p>With this the sergeant proceeded to take account
of stock. After a careful survey of his
wounds, he dressed and bandaged them as best
he could, and took a bracer from the whiskey
flask, with which the haversack of the army
scout who knows his business is always supplied.
He followed the stimulant with a meagre
breakfast from his rations.</p>

<p>It was not long before Johnny was strong
enough to get upon his feet. The first thing he
did was to inspect the wounded Filipino. To
facilitate matters he kneeled beside the fellow
and rolled him over upon his back. As he
glanced at the cruel, savage face, it seemed
strangely familiar. Looking at the face more
critically, as suspicion of the identity of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
fallen foe entered his mind, he brushed back the
mat of coarse hair that covered the Filipino’s
forehead. There, running transversely across
the brow, close to the tangled hair, was a livid,
jagged scar of an old time sword stroke. Forgetting
his own wounds he sprang to his feet
in amazed delight and exclaimed, “Agramonte,
or I’m an Indian!”</p>

<p>The Filipino was evidently recovering consciousness.
He too, had suffered from a severe
loss of blood. Johnny examined his enemy’s
wound and found that the blood had clotted
and was no longer flowing. He applied a compress
and bandage and gave the wounded
man a swig of whiskey, with the result that he
soon revived sufficiently to recognize his surroundings.
If he remembered the encounter
that had been so unlucky for him he made no
sign. As soon as he became conscious, he ceased
groaning and made no sound thereafter. He
lay as stolidly as a manikin, his beady black eyes
watching every move the soldier made.</p>

<p>Noting that his patient was rounding up
nicely, and fearing that he might cry for assistance,
Johnny proceeded to make the situation
clear to the Filipino. Not daring to use fire
arms for fear of bringing a swarm of brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
bellies about his ears, he had not yet drawn a
revolver. He did so now, however, although
with as little intention of using it as ever. Leveling
the navy at the wounded man’s head he said:
“I don’t know whether you savvy my language
or not, Mr. Agramonte, but I reckon you can
savvy sign language all right. You saved me a
lot o’ trouble when you an’ your partner did
the wild cat act on my back. I was sure lookin’
for you, but I didn’t expect to come up with you
quite so immediate. Seein’ as how you saved me
so much trouble, I’ll give you a tip that’ll save
you some. If you open your yap, even to whisper,
I’ll scatter your brains all over the province.
I’ve got a pressin’ engagement to take
you to headquarters, and this is a mighty good
place to start from. It’s just about time to
mosey, too, for some of your friends is likely to
rubber down here to see what’s doin’.”</p>

<p>Agramonte evidently “savvied,” but he contented
himself with glaring at his conqueror as
some captive savage beast might have done.
It required little discernment to guess what he
would have done to the Americano, had their
respective positions been reversed.</p>

<p>Still menacing the Filipino with the revolver,
Johnny compelled him to struggle to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
feet as best he could. Unwinding his lariat
he put the noose about his captive’s neck.
Thinking evidently that he was about to be
hanged and thus receive poetic justice, Agramonte
would have cried out, had not his captor
suddenly tugged at the lasso, thus choking the
sound of alarm in his brown throat. The
strangling process was quite effective, and when
the noose was loosened the prisoner was as
docile as could have been desired.</p>

<p>Leaving some six feet of rope between himself
and his captive, the sergeant, after adjusting
the noose, wound the other end of the lariat
about his own body. This done, he said,
“Now, Mr. Filipino, you can’t lose me, and
if you don’t object we’ll take a little stroll together.
Just to be perlite I’ll let you go first,
so just mosey right along an’ don’t look back
or make any noise. If you bat your eye in a
way I don’t like, away’ll go your brains to
fertilize the Island of Luzon. It’s us for the
river, so skip along, an’ make it lively.”</p>

<p>But making it lively was easier said than
done. Neither the prisoner nor the captive
was in condition to travel rapidly, and the
mere effort of clambering down the river bank
was almost the limit of their endurance. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Johnny shut his teeth together like the bars
of a steel trap, and pushing the tottering Filipino
roughly into the water, waded slowly
after him, retracing the same route he had
traversed in crossing the river. In their exhausted
condition it was not easy for the men
to maintain their footing. Agramonte’s feet
slipped from under him several times, bringing
him face downward on the sand and rocks
of the river bed. The soldier, although himself
in little better form than his prisoner, by a
supreme effort raised the latter to his feet and
relentlessly urged him on. The island reached,
the two fell exhausted.</p>

<p>As the soldier and his prisoner lay panting
upon the ground it seemed to Johnny that
rest was the only thing worth living for. He
did not dare gratify his inclination in that direction,
however. The body of the dead Filipino
was likely to be found at any moment,
for it was probable that he had been on picket
duty, and if so, a relief would probably be sent
to that point before long. Pursuit once begun,
escape would be well nigh impossible. Should
he be captured the soldier knew only too well
what would happen. Another ghastly token<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
of Agramonte’s affection would be sent to the
American camp.</p>

<p>Staggering to his feet, Johnny fairly dragged
his prisoner to a standing posture. He compelled
the Filipino to take several swallows
of the whiskey, drank a stiff one himself, and
driving Agramonte before him continued on
his way around the edge of the island. When
they arrived at the opposite side, the Filipino,
gazing terror stricken at the swift current in
mid-stream, stopped short and shook his head
in feeble protest against entering the water.</p>

<p>“It does look middlin’ dubious, that’s a fact,
an’ it’s goin’ to be a close call, but we’ve got
to make it,” said Johnny. “I promised the Captain
that I’d land you at the door of his tent,
and land you I will. He’d be glad to have
your head to even up for poor Jack Kennedy’s,
but it’ll please him better if I deliver your
ugly carcass to him whole. In with you, d—n
you, and no monkey business or I’ll”—and
Johnny cocked his revolver, which clicked suggestively.</p>

<p>The Filipino slipped into the water and
would have gone down post haste, had not the
soldier supported him by his tangle of coarse
hair. And then began the supreme struggle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Many times as he battled with the current
did Johnny regret that he had not decapitated
Agramonte and taken his head into camp.
But once in the swift running water he would
not weaken, nor would he let go of his prisoner.
He resolved that if Agramonte went down,
he would drown with him, rather than return
to the captain empty handed. Twice the two
struggling men were swept under, but thanks
to Johnny’s bull dog grit rose again. They
were swimming diagonally against the current,
and it was almost miraculous that both
men were not drowned. Had the middle channel
been a few yards wider, they certainly
would never have lived to reach the next island.</p>

<p>But reach the island they did, and with a
desperate effort Johnny pulled himself upon
dry land, dragging his half dead charge after
him. After a somewhat longer rest than before,
the two again entered the water, and
with great difficulty waded to shore on the opposite
side of the Batolan. Once the awful
strain of crossing the river was over, there was
no longer any choice in the matter of resting;
both men fell exhausted; Johnny had barely
strength enough left to crawl into the brake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
out of the range of vision of possible stray Filipinos
and pull his half dead captive after him.</p>

<p>The sun was well up in the heavens and
beating mercilessly down upon captor and captive
before Johnny was able to move. He
finally managed to get upon his feet again and
decided to take a fresh start toward the camp.
It seemed safer to take the chance of meeting
hostile natives in the jungle in broad daylight,
than to remain until nightfall and then
run the risk of being found by a searching party
of the enemy. The Filipino, however, was
unable to rise. He was wounded no more severely
than his captor, and surely should have
been no worse affected by the fatigue of his
journey, but he was a prisoner, and lacked the
spirit of a victor, and, like most children of
the tropics, he had not the physical nor moral
fibre of which strenuous heroes are made.
He was certainly “all in,” much to our soldier’s
dismay. Urging and threats alike were
without avail, and when dragged to his feet
the renegade fell to the ground again as limp
as a rag. Knowing that camp was but a few
hours distant, Johnny’s disgust at the situation
was most violent, and he swore in salvos.</p>

<p>“You d—d cut-throat, you’re more trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
than your miserable neck is worth! You
might have been game enough to stick to the
finish. But you wasn’t, so there you are, an’
I reckon it’s up to me to get you to camp the
best way I can. Come, Aggie, old boy, an’
rest on this bosom;” saying which, the soldier
helped the Filipino to his feet once more, and
half carrying, half dragging the almost helpless
man, struck out through the brake.</p>

<p>The will is a wonderful thing;—it conquers
worlds,—but no man’s will is so strong that
extreme physical weakness will not defeat it.
Johnny’s nerve was impregnable, but wounded
and fatigued as he was, his physical strength
could not withstand the additional strain put
upon it by the endeavor to assist the Filipino
through the jungle. Then too, his wounds had
become inflamed and very painful. He felt
alternately hot and cold, and finally had a chill
that fairly made his teeth rattle. This was
followed by a tremendous fever. The poor
fellow felt as though he were on fire. Things
began to look queer. From time to time he
fancied he saw fantastic shapes amid the brake.
Sometimes huge, fiercely snarling animals seemed
to brush by him. Again, a Filipino, twice
as large as life, leered at him from behind every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
bush and tree. Once he fancied he saw the
huge serpent that had flailed his chest the
night he spent in traversing the jungle. Its
horrid mouth yawned widely, and he heard it
calling in a hoarse roaring voice the multitudinous
folk of the jungle. And the soldier
knew that the delirium of wound fever was
upon him, and feared lest he should lose his
senses altogether.</p>

<p>Bad as was his captor’s condition, the Filipino’s
was much worse. When nature could
stand no more, and Johnny was finally compelled
to drop the renegade, it was evident that
the latter’s end was in sight. A few drops of
whiskey poured down his throat revived him
for a brief period, but it was hate’s labor lost,
for within the hour Agramonte gave a faint
expiring sigh and joined the shades of his
brown skinned ancestors.</p>

<p>Johnny had fallen exhausted beside the body
of his captive and supporting himself on his
elbow had watched, in his lucid intervals, the
passing of his chances of delivering the living
Agramonte to Captain Benning. The Filipino
dead, there was but one thing to be done.
The gathering of evidence was as simple as
it was gruesome; he drew his knife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
decapitated the body, making in his weakened
condition, it must be confessed, rather a
“hacky,” tearing job of it. The head removed
and tied by its long hair to his belt, Johnny
rose to his feet and totteringly resumed his
journey toward camp.</p>

<p>As our soldier uncertainly blundered on
through the brake, his fever rose higher and
higher and his delirium increased. There were
no longer any lucid intervals, and the direction
of his steps was largely a matter of chance.
Good luck, rather than volition guided him, but
while his course was the proper one, luck was
not always with him. Several times his feet
became entangled in the undergrowth and
he fell heavily. Again, as he struggled to his
feet and stumbled blindly on, he crashed
against a tree so violently that only the fictitious
strength of delirium prevented his being
incapacitated from further effort. But every
step was bring him nearer his comrades, and
nearer the fulfillment of the promise which no
longer meant anything to him, poor boy.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The evening relief of sentries had just been
made by Company K. The sun had dropped
his huge glowing ball of molten copper behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
the hills to the west of Masillo. The waning
light was playing hide and seek with the flickering,
erratic shadows of wood and brake. At
the edge of the little clearing just outside the
town stood a khaki clad sentry. He was leaning
upon his rifle and gazing abstractedly into the
jungle, thinking, perhaps, of that rancher’s
daughter in far-away Montana. As he stood
there musing, his attention was suddenly
attracted by a rustling sound amid the undergrowth
some distance away. He instantly
brought his gun to a ready, and peered excitedly
into the jungle. The sound grew plainer.</p>

<p>“Halt! Who goes there?”</p>

<p>A shape as of a man creeping stealthily
along through the brake upon his hands and
knees became dimly discernible. Again the
sentry’s voice rang out.</p>

<p>“Halt, or I fire!”</p>

<p>The shape, now plainly that of a man, crept
nearer and still nearer.</p>

<p>The Krag cracked like a huge whip, a thin,
filmy cloud of smoke arose from the nitro, and
the creeping form in the brake fell forward upon
its face without a sound.</p>

<p>“Corporal of the guard, post seven!” shouted
the sentry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
The regulation call was unnecessary for,
immediately the rifle cracked, a squad of the
sentry’s comrades with the corporal at their
head rushed to the spot.</p>

<p>“I’ve bagged a brown belly, I think,” said
the sentry, waving his hand in the direction of
the spot where his quarry had fallen.</p>

<p>The corporal, followed by his men, cautiously
approached the spot indicated by the sentry.
A few minutes search in the cane and they
came upon a body clothed in tattered khaki.
Hanging from the belt at the dead man’s side,
was the recently decapitated head of a Filipino.</p>

<p>The startled corporal turned the body over
upon its back. He gave one horrified glance
of recognition at the dead man’s face and
exclaimed, “My God! It’s Johnny!”</p>

<p>Tenderly the men in khaki raised the limp
form of their fallen comrade and silently bore
it past the horror stricken sentry into the camp.
Halting before the captain’s tent, they laid the
body down and covered it reverently with a
blanket.</p>

<p>The corporal approached the door of the tent
and addressing his commander, said sorrowfully,
his eyes wet with tears, “Sir, Johnny has
returned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Captain Benning sprang to his feet and
exclaimed, “Where is he; why does he not
report?”</p>

<p>“He is here, sir,” replied the corporal. The
captain went to the door of the tent, and not
seeing Johnny, looked at the corporal inquiringly.</p>

<p>The corporal pointed to the body lying
almost at the officer’s feet and said, “That’s
him, sir.”</p>

<p>The captain raised the blanket, and gazed
long and silently at the dead soldier and the
gory testimonial of duty performed that lay
beside him.</p>

<p>The silence was finally broken by the corporal,
who said, as his hand rose slowly in <span class="locked">salute—</span></p>

<p>“Sir, Johnny has made good.”</p>

<p>And the captain replied, huskily:</p>

<p>“Yes, boys, too good.”</p>

<h2 id="MY_FRIEND_THE_UNDERTAKER">MY FRIEND THE UNDERTAKER</h2>
</div>

<p>I have become quite convinced that the most
entertaining man in the world is the undertaker.
Now, I do not pretend to say that there is anything
original about my observations. Others
have in all probability frequently commented
on his peculiarities—but I nevertheless feel that
it is my duty to give him a little attention in
order to repay him, at least in part, for the many
favors received at his hands.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that I am no more indebted
to the “post-medical profession” than
are many other physicians, but I am peculiar
in that I always like to express my gratitude to
those who have befriended me—and if there is
any office that friendship can perform for us,
equal to concealing one’s mistakes and hiding
one’s failures from the gaze of a carping and
cruel world, I don’t know what it is.</p>

<div id="ip_160" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="395" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“CUSTOM-MADE SORROW”</div></div>

<p>Another reason for my determination to devote
a little personal attention to the undertaker
is that he is a much maligned and misunderstood
person. He is supposed to be heartless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
unfeeling, and is usually considered austere and
unapproachable; some say he has no generosity.</p>

<p>It shall be my pleasure, as well as my duty, to
correct these erroneous impressions regarding
a noble craft that has always taken a lively interest
in its patrons—an interest that has never
been reciprocated by those most benefited by
the undertaker’s labors.</p>

<p>There may be captious critics who will differ
with my belief that the undertaker is the most
entertaining man in the world, on the ground
that those whom he entertains never give
him any <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">encores</i>. This is very easily explained.
There are no gallery gods at his entertainments,
and the people in the boxes are never demonstrative.
They are people of taste and discretion,
and rather reserved and sedate than
otherwise;—knowing when they have had
enough of a good thing, they do not attempt
to recall the artist. Unquestionably, the
chief patrons of the undertaker are people of
refined susceptibilities and not given to demonstration.
Even when a clod is rung in
upon the boards, they give no sign of anything
but courteous and silent attention—although
the nerves of others in the audience
may be fairly set on edge. It is hardly necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
to expatiate further on my first proposition.</p>

<p>The austerity of the undertaker is more
apparent than real, and is the result of association
rather than innate acerbity of feeling.
Even when he is iciest and most frigid in his
ways it is for the benefit of others. By such
a demeanor he enables his patrons to maintain
their composure even under circumstances the
most trying and in all kinds of weather. What
though he does shroud his real feelings in an
atmosphere of chilling reserve, so long as his
heart is warm and true! Were he less calm
and philosophic, he might err on the side of
sympathy and ere long some of his friends
would find that they had unconsciously been
placed in a very bad box.</p>

<p>As to his being unapproachable, I believe
that the undertaker is misunderstood. It is
true that he does not thrust himself forward
in a pretentious manner—as do some people
of inferior breeding—nor has he ever been
known to meet a patron half way, but just let
one of your friends hint that you need his services
and see how quickly he will put in an
appearance. And he will not pay you unnecessarily
prolonged visits either, and should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
you be compelled to entertain him for a time,
he is a quite inexpensive guest—he always furnishes
his own board. He is even likely to be
offended if you force your hospitality upon him.
One of my friends once made this mistake,
and the undertaker gave him a great laying out,
I assure you.</p>

<p>We mustn’t be too hard upon the undertaker,
then, even though he is a trifle stiff and conventional
in his ways. His work furnishes
him with subjects for contemplation which
are so serious, and of such monumental importance,
that it is small wonder he should
acquire a somewhat funereal and solemn demeanor.</p>

<p>I have often marveled at the equability
of temper displayed by the undertaker. I never
heard of his swearing at, or using rough language
to his patrons. He has such a soothing
way with him, too; whenever he notices
that his patron is inclined to get a little hotheaded
he does everything in his power to
allay his warmth, knowing full well that the
man will get cooled down after a while.
And his judgment is rarely at fault—the other
fellow always does cool down. You see, it’s
a poor quarrel that won’t keep—and the undertaker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
differences with his patrons are no exception
to the rule.</p>

<p>It has always been a source of wonderment
to me, that any one could accuse the undertaker
of being heartless and unfeeling. Why,
I have known undertakers who were the acme
of tender susceptibility and delicacy of feeling.
One mortuary gentleman whom I knew,
had such a sympathetic vein in his composition
that he used to mix lamp black with his
embalming fluid. So considerate and thoughtful
of him, was it not? And shall we say of
such men, “They are heartless and unfeeling?”
Never!</p>

<p>And what shall we say of the “funeral director”
who had buried six husbands for a
lady, and who, knowing how sensitive she was
upon the subject, upholstered her own mortuary
receptacle with white satin marked with
six delicate bands of heliotrope? Could any
human being display a finer intuitive perception
of the eternal fitness of things?</p>

<p>No, the undertaker is not unsympathetic,
and he is delicacy personified.</p>

<p>Let us cultivate the undertaker—he does
all he can to cultivate us. And he is an unselfish
cultivator too—he knoweth full well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
that what he soweth he cannot reap. Let
us cultivate him, therefore, and do our best to
repay him for his kindness to humanity. And
we may possibly profit thereby, for pleasant
associations retard the decay of these mortal
frames of ours—the remorseless scythe of
time blunts upon those fortunate mortals who
are favored by the kindly offices of the skillful
undertaker. To them we may not inappropriately
say, “How well preserved you are!”</p>

<p>How well, indeed!</p>

<p>It would seem unnecessary to say that the
popular notion regarding the undertaker’s lack
of generosity is wrong—the fact should be self-evident.
I feel, however, that my whole duty
would not be done, did I not say that in my
opinion the undertaker is one of the most generous
of men. What merchant would ever dismiss
a patron without an endeavor to secure his
future patronage? None, I fancy. But not
so your undertaker—he is willing, aye, even
anxious, to let somebody else have his patrons
after he has filled their first order. He is often,
apparently, very glad to get his customers off
his hands—not caring a whit if some professional
rival gets their custom. And the social position
of his patron seems to make no material difference—indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
the “higher” the person, the more
anxious the undertaker is to see the case fall
into some rival’s hands. Some might say that
this is due to a disposition to make game of the
customer, but I don’t believe it.</p>

<p>There is one characteristic that distinguishes
the undertaker from the common herd of men
with mercantile instincts; he is scrupulously
honest. He always gives full measure. This
is very comforting to his patrons—especially
those who like a comfortable fit. There is not
a tailoring establishment in this blessed town
that can show such a record as my friend Blank,
the undertaker. Why, he has been making
underclothing most all his life and never yet
had a misfit turned back on his hands.</p>

<p>I tell you what, my good friends, the undertaker
is the last man in the world with whom
we have occasion to find fault.</p>

<p>I shall always entertain a high personal
regard for some of the members of the undertaking
profession.</p>

<p>If there is any attribute of man especially to
be admired, it is a keen sense of humor. One
of my undertaker friends—long since dead and
gone to a just reward—one Nathaniel Black,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
had this faculty developed to a preternatural
degree.</p>

<p>There was something very impressive in the
skillful manner in which Nathaniel used to conceal
his humorous impulses while in the presence
of death. His air of subdued merriment was,
it is true, painful at times,—especially to himself—but
this made it all the more impressive, as
showing how some spirits can, by exercising will
power, rise superior to their immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>When my friend Black was away from the
actual presence of a corpse, he would unbend
and show the true inward cussedness of the born
humorist—with the evident self-sacrificing purpose
of making life pleasant for his many
friends. I happened to be one of the fortunate
individuals who luxuriated in his friendship, and
will cheerfully bear testimony to his devotion
to the occupation of increasing the happiness of
those about him. I feel that I could do no less,
without stamping myself an ingrate.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did on entering
practice, many years ago, was to invest in a
typic doctor’s buggy. This was done in self-defense—my
face was as smooth as a pippin,
my mustache was a caricature of the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
article and, taken all in all, there was nothing
about me to inspire confidence. There was
consequently but one thing to do, and that was
to look and act as professional and prosperous
as possible. It was with this end in view that
I bought a buggy which looked unmistakably
professional. As I had many friends and
acquaintances, the moral effect of my turn-out
was excellent. Had I been able to live on
moral effect life would have been one vast smile
of peaceful, well-fed joy and contentment, but
I could not dine on any sort of effect, least of all
upon the moral variety—which is a delusion
and a snare.</p>

<p>Observing the marked attention that was
paid to my equipage—and incidentally to the
prosperous young doctor—I was well pleased;
there were times when even my stomach was
forgotten. It seemed to me that it was better
to ride on an empty stomach than to walk upon
a full one, provided I attracted sufficient attention
to warrant my remaining in practice—or
the hope of practice.</p>

<p>On some occasions the people I met appeared
especially delighted with my appearance. Being
self-satisfied with the notion that I was at
last beginning to be appreciated, I made no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
investigations to determine why so much more
attention should be paid to me on some occasions
than upon others. Such is the blinding
power of self-conceit!</p>

<p>The advisability of hiring a colored driver
suggested itself to me as an additional bait for
popular applause. The idea so impressed me
that I consulted one of my friends, Jack T——
about it. He advised me to wait a while, and
seemed much entertained by my story of increasing
popularity.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy,” said he, smilingly, “you are
indeed getting on in the world. Let me see—you
lecture at a medical college, are surgeon to
a free dispensary, physician to the order of Sons
of the Blue Hen, physician to the hospital of
the Big Sisters of the Rich, medical examiner for
the Knights of the Empty Cupboard, and have
the swellest turn-out in town. You certainly
are to be congratulated.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack,” I said, “I feel that my career
is full of promise. By the way, old man, lend
me a dollar, will you? This is my day for dining—every
third day, you know. I’ll pay you
back next week.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, doctor, I am happy to contribute
to the comfort of one whose future is so brightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
illumined by—promise. But, nevertheless, I
still maintain that it is too early in the action
for you to think of a colored coachman—every
third day is—”</p>

<p>“Well, Jack,” I interrupted, “I must be
going. Much obliged for your contribution
to the free silver question. And, by the way,
I’m just on my way to a meeting of the county
commissioners. I’m slated for the County
Hospital Staff.”</p>

<p>“Oh—h—h!” groaned Jack. “Has your ambition
for wealth no bounds?”</p>

<p>A day or two later I was driving at a “sent for”
gait, down Michigan Avenue, enjoying the
evident admiring approbation of the people
whom I met, when I saw my friend Jack a
short distance ahead of me. He caught sight
of me, stopped short and walked out to the
curb, where he awaited me with a decidedly
pleased expression on his handsome face.</p>

<p>“Hello, doctor!” he cried, as I drove up to
him and reined in my horse. “You seem to
have a bad case on hand.”</p>

<p>I winked and said, “Never mind the case.
Come along with me for a ride. You have
nothing else to do at this hour of the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
“Don’t care if I do,” replied my friend,
stepping into my buggy forthwith.</p>

<p>My rig continued to attract considerable
attention, much to Jack’s edification, apparently.
He finally said, “Well, doctor, your
turn-out does excite the interest of the public,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“So I have already informed you,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, doctor,” said Jack, “you
know that I am your friend. As a friend it is
my duty to prevent you from acquiring that
fatal pride which ever precedes a fall. I have
hesitated to explain your popularity to you,
but for your own sake and to preserve my own
health, I must do so.”</p>

<p>“Why, what the deuce do you mean?” I
asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Look behind you, doctor.”</p>

<p>I looked through the rear window of my
phæton, and saw, about fifty yards behind me,
a long, black, undertaker’s wagon. On the
seat, driving the sorry-looking steeds that were
drawing the horribly suggestive vehicle, was—my
friend, Nathaniel Black!</p>

<p>My undertaking friend was by no means
quietly pursuing his gloomy way, but was
gesticulating and winking suggestively to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
people on the side walk. He would first flirt
his knobby thumb in my direction with a
“D’ye see him?” gesture, and then, with a
“That’s what I’m here for” wink at everybody
in sight, would grin all over his ugly face.</p>

<p>“A horrible coincidence!” I said faintly.</p>

<p>“Coincidence nothing!” howled Jack. “He’s
been doing that ever since you got your new
buggy!”</p>

<p>And I bought wine for Nathaniel, and for
Jack, and for sundry of their friends—yea,
and for all who were within the sound of their
voices in their daily walks.</p>

<p>But, I borrowed the wherewithal to settle
from Jack. And, by and by, when practice
came, I gave my patronage to Nathaniel’s rivals.</p>

<p>Was the joke on me?</p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>There are some doctors who do not understand
the precise relation that the noble profession
of undertaking desires to bear to the
medical man. I freely confess that I myself
was ignorant on this point until quite recently.</p>

<p>In a certain neighborhood of this metropolis
dwells an undertaker of more than local renown
whose reputation has been built up largely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
virtue of certain natural attributes that peculiarly
fit him for the practice of his profession;—indeed,
I have never met a man more to the
manner born as regards fitness for his—shall I
say, life work, or would “death work” be more
appropriate?</p>

<p>Mr. Weeps is one of those mournful-looking
persons, who seem to be constantly on the
verge of tears. His expression is of a most
sympathetic nature, and his eyes seem ever
ready to exude the saline fluid that is so essential
to the expression of sincere sorrow and regret.
It might be remarked in passing, that there are
numerous theories explanatory of the redness
and humidity of those bleary orbs. Personally,
I repudiate the onion theory altogether,
and incline to the view that Mr. Weeps’ ocular
peculiarities are dependent upon a combination
of catarrh and polypi obstructing the nasal
ducts. The “red eye” theory, advanced by
one of his homeopathic constituents, is unworthy
of consideration—especially as my
lugubrious friend has been superintendent of
a Sunday school for ten years and has served
two terms as alderman.</p>

<p>But, whatever, may be the true explanation,
Weeps’ eyes appear to have been especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
designed for his vocation. There is no other
business—unless it be selling milk—to which
those watery orbs could possibly be so well
adapted as to undertaking.</p>

<p>I cannot claim to be on terms of intimacy
with Mr. Weeps, and therefore do not feel warranted
in attempting a detailed description of
his many physical peculiarities—it would, however,
be manifestly unfair to that most estimable
gentleman, did I not dwell upon his eyes.</p>

<p>In the course of my semi-occasional peregrinations
into Mr. Weeps’ neighborhood, it transpired
that one of my patients, with malice both
prepense and aforethought—and consumption—did
leave his little lung behind and hie him
heavenward.</p>

<p>My kindly and well meant offices being no
longer necessary, I naturally supposed that my
responsibility had ceased. Not so, however—I
was asked to recommend an undertaker.
Having heard of Mr. Weeps and his phenomenal
skill, I suggested that the family consult him as
to the further management of the case. It
seems that the family took my advice and was
highly gratified with the pleasant and expeditious
manner in which he performed his important
functions. Indeed, the friends of the party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
chiefly interested were so well pleased, that they
thanked me a few days later, for recommending
a gentleman of so much talent and such a sympathetic
nature. I, of course, appreciated the
family’s gratitude, although the service rendered
was quite unusual in my experience. Some
unfeeling persons might say that the large life
insurance policies left by the deceased were an
element in the gratitude the family expressed to
me, but, my dear reader, the very thought would
be cruel and ignoble. Without confidence in
human nature life would be miserable for all of
us—and especially for doctors.</p>

<p>A few days after the funeral I received a call
from Mr. Weeps. There seemed to be no end
to the gratitude which was believed to be due
me. Weeps had called to express his. He
appeared to be as well pleased with the family
as its members were with him.</p>

<p>I had never had the honor of meeting Mr.
Weeps before, but his suave and cordial manner
of introducing himself put me at my ease at
once. The pleasure of acquaintance was of
course mutual; it always is, you know.</p>

<p>After thanking me most cordially for my
courtesy in referring the case of the late Mr.
B—— to him, Mr. Weeps said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
“Now, doctor, I shall always be glad to have
you remember me whenever you happen to be
in my neighborhood.”</p>

<p>I looked at him suspiciously, but saw no
murder in his eye; he was as oily and plausible
as ever.</p>

<p>“You see,” he continued, “I have never had
the honor of serving any of your patients before,
and am very glad to have the opportunity of
getting at least a small portion of your business.”</p>

<p>The fellow seemed to be getting a little personal,
but I made no remark, and he went on
with his little piece.</p>

<p>“I will see you again in a few days, doctor—as
soon as I have been compensated for my
labors in this particular case. You, of course,
understand that I will extend to you in this
case, as in all future cases, the same courtesies
I usually extend to the medical profession.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!” I exclaimed, “and of what do
those courtesies consist?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, blandly, “they are quite
liberal, considering the hard times—<em>about twenty-five
per cent.</em>”</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
“’Tis strange—but true; for truth is always strange.<br />
<span class="in1">Stranger than fiction.”</span>
</p>

<p>Among all the undertakers I ever knew my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
feelings have been seriously disturbed by but
one.</p>

<p>The gentleman in question is fat, jolly—when
off duty—and a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon vivant</i> of the ideal type.
He is a ubiquitous sort of chap, and I find myself
stumbling over him quite frequently—in the
most unexpected places and under the most
embarrassing circumstances. No social gathering
seems to be complete without him—much
to my discomfiture.</p>

<p>Words cannot express the embarrassment I
have suffered at the hands of my fat friend.
The worst of the matter is that the fellow really
likes me—you needn’t smile, gentle reader;
his fondness does not depend upon reasons of
a business nature; he likes me for myself alone.
It will be seen, therefore, that I cannot afford
to say anything which might by any possibility
offend him. Aside from his affection for me,
there is another motive which impels me to
avoid personalities—he is high-strung and sensitive
to a degree, and, if report speaks true, an
expert boxer. To be sure, those whom he has
boxed have said nothing about his proficiency,
but where one’s own personal safety is concerned
one is justified in giving due weight even to idle
rumor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
Now, it may seem strange that I should find
fault with a man who has so sincere a regard
for me as my fat friend, but, you know, even
affection may be over done. When a fellow
dresses up on Sunday preparatory to calling on
his best girl, and his pet dog lavishes caresses
with his muddy paws on those eleven dollar
lavender trousers, patience ceases to be a virtue—and
the comparison is by no means far-fetched.</p>

<p>Whenever I board a crowded street car, that
obese mortuary fiend is always aboard—and
at the end of the car farthest from me. He
never fails to see and recognize me, although I
go through as many motions as a professional
contortionist in the vain and frantic effort to
avoid recognition.</p>

<p>And then you should hear him yell, “Hello,
Doc! How are all the folks?”</p>

<p>I assure him that I am greatly obliged for
his rather suggestive solicitude for the welfare
of my family, and that the folks are all well.</p>

<p>He next asks me how business is, and when I
answer, “First rate,” with a tone of sorrowing
reproof he informs me that it is “very quiet with
<em>him</em>.” As if his business is not supposed to be
invariably quiet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
The party sitting next me leaves the car;
the undertaker pushes through the crowd
and with a “How d’ye do, old man?” and an
ostentatious pump-handle shake of my hand
that almost costs me several fingers, takes the
vacant seat beside me.</p>

<p>And now comes a conversation—his part of
which is audible to everybody on the car—relative
to the “last case we had together.” The
brute even mentions the party’s name, which,
if it happens to be a well known one, excites the
rapt attention of everybody within earshot.</p>

<p>He next proceeds to ask me to dine with
him “to-morrow” and comments on the “elegant
time we had together last week.”</p>

<p>Finally arriving at his destination, my demon
bids me an affectionate good night and starts for
the farther door of the car. I breathe a sigh of
relief—but too soon. Having reached the platform
he re-opens the door and bellows <span class="locked">out—</span></p>

<p>“By the way, Doc! do you think old man
Blank is going to pull through? Old friend of
mine, you know—I’ll probably be in on the case
when the thing’s over.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I went to the opera the other night hoping—aye,
determined to enjoy myself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
feeling that I was entitled to a little enjoyment,
for I had had very little opera in my
daily routine for some months. My wife was
looking very well, and my mirror gave positive
proof that my new dress suit was an
unexceptionable fit. All things considered I
had every reason to feel well satisfied with myself
and the world at large.</p>

<p>But how vain are human hopes. We were
hardly comfortably seated, before I saw in the
box directly opposite mine—the fat undertaker
who haunted my dreams!</p>

<p>I endeavored to avoid recognition, but it was
no use. He saw me, and gesticulated so wildly
to attract my attention that I was perforce
obliged to respond in self-defense. The house
being crowded, this little episode attracted
much attention—especially on the part of
numerous friends of the undertaker and myself,
who, as luck would have it, happened to be
present. These people smiled broadly; some
even went so far as to wink significantly at each
other.</p>

<p>The fat undertaker is one of those men who
succeed in attracting attention at all times and
under all circumstances. On this occasion he
shone with effulgent brilliancy. He enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the play—there was no doubt about that—and
proposed to make me enjoy it also. Whenever
the performance especially pleased him, he
applauded vociferously, quivering all over like
a lump of calf’s-foot jelly and gesticulating
furiously in my direction. Having succeeded
in attracting my attention, he would jerk his
fat thumb in the direction of the artist who was
favored with his approbation and nod emphatically
at me.</p>

<p>The audience enjoyed my friend’s enthusiasm
and seemed quite anxious to know how <em>I</em> was
enjoying it. I couldn’t enlighten it as intelligently
as could have been wished, so I did the
next best thing—I went out between acts to see
a man—and found him so highly interesting that
I forgot to go back. Suddenly remembering
that my wife was still in the box, I sent an usher
to inform her that I wasn’t feeling well and was
waiting for her at the door. Being a wise
woman, she divined the cause of my indisposition
and soon joined me. She didn’t feel quite
comfortable herself, and was glad to escape
from—the opera.</p>

<p>I have forsworn society. I have bought an
automobile, and if ever I go to the theater
again—may the fat undertaker seize me!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="A_GRIM_MEMENTO">A GRIM MEMENTO</h2>
</div>

<p>My friend, Dr. Fairweather, was engaged
when I called, but it so happened that I was
in no hurry and could conveniently wait. I
have since been glad that things happened as
they did; had I not been compelled to wait and
amuse myself as best I could, I probably should
not have heard what to me was a most interesting
story. The colored attendant who took
my card and announced me to the doctor,
returned and said:</p>

<p>“De doctah is right busy just now, suh.
He says fo’ you alls to be sho to wait, cayse he
wants to see you mos’ pow’ful. I reckon you
alls better wait in dis yeh room, suh. De
doctah says dat you must mek yo’sef to
home.”</p>

<p>The servant ushered me into a small apartment,
evidently the doctor’s “den,” and handed
me the morning paper, which I proceeded to
hungrily devour. The paper was the first I
had seen in a month—I was just returning
from my summer outing trip, and had stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
off <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> at P. to see my old friend Fairweather.</p>

<p>The doctor was detained for some time, and
having finished reading my paper, I proceeded
to inspect the curios with which the room was
garnished. I had examined with great interest
the fine collection of odd Indian relics and
the queer weapons from the four quarters of the
earth, and was returning to my seat by the
window when a grinning human skull upon
the mantel caught my eye.</p>

<p>It so happens that the human skull is of
especial interest to me because of a certain
hobby that I enjoy riding at odd moments. I
am something of an enthusiast in the subjects
of criminology and the relation of the contour
and development of the skull to mental and
moral qualities. It was with some curiosity
therefore, that I picked up the skull and proceeded
to critically examine it. I found it well
worthy of study and regretted that I could give
it only cursory attention.</p>

<p>The dwarfed frontal development; the great
length of the face; the enormously large, protruding
jaw; the huge orbits, with the great
projecting bony prominences—the frontal bosses—above
them; the general lightness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
bones; the unsymmetrical conformation of the
face and the twisted and undeveloped dome
of the skull presented a picture that is very
familiar to the student of criminal anthropology.</p>

<p>So absorbed was I in the contemplation of
the gruesome relic I held in my hands, that I
was not conscious of the entrance of Dr. Fairweather
until he spoke.</p>

<p>“Hello, old man!—riding your hobby as
usual, I see. No time for your friends, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>I grasped the doctor’s welcoming hand and
replied, “Well, as you were busy, I had to kill
time as best I might with this gentleman. He
is a poor conversationist, hence I was compelled
to utilize him in any way that I could. I must
admit that I have found him very interesting—inversely
to his loquacity, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed; and what do you make of him?”</p>

<p>“Looking for a chance to guy me, eh?”
I replied. “Really, old fellow, time does not
mellow you a bit. Well, guy away. I am
not prepared to give you a critical dissertation
on this particular skull. This much I will say,
however—it has more of the ear marks of the
degenerate than any I have seen for some time.
The party who originally owned the skull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
should have been a desperado, or a hold-up
man, although he may have passed the hat in
church for aught I know—which may be a
distinction without a difference.”</p>

<p>Dr. Fairweather laughed heartily. “Well,
I don’t know but that I ought to resent your
criticisms of the skull. I can forgive your slam
at the church, but it is my duty to inform you
that the gentleman of whom that skull is a
relic was a very particular friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you are keeping the skull as a
memento of your friend. There’s no accounting
for tastes, you know,” I said, watching the
doctor suspiciously out of the corner of my eye
and recalling that he had as strong a predilection
for practical jokes as I had for skulls.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is precisely it,” replied the doctor
seriously. “I have two mementos of my dead
friend; one—post mortem—you hold in your
hand; the other—ante mortem—is here,” and
he threw back from his forehead the long, wavy,
dark hair in which threads of silver were beginning
to show and pointed to a long, livid,
jagged scar that traversed his left temple.</p>

<p>I looked at the doctor in surprise. Although
I had known him for many years, I had never
noticed his disfigurement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
“I don’t think I ever told you the story, did
I?” continued the doctor.</p>

<p>I replied in the negative, assuring my friend
that nothing could please me better than to
hear him tell it.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m through with patients for to-day,
and if you will do me the honor of dining with
me at the club, I shall be most happy to relate
it to you.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“You will remember that I was formerly
engaged in general practice in the little town of
R—— in Northern Minnesota. My field was
an arduous one and I could not select my
patients—on the contrary, I was mighty glad
when they condescended to select me. It’s
quite different now; I can be ‘in’ or ‘out,’ as
I may elect, when patients ring my bell. Better
than all, I can ask an old friend to dine with me
at the club. There <em>is</em> a club, thank heaven, and
there is also the wherewithal nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I was fortunate enough, early in my practice,
to receive an appointment as the local
surgeon of the St. Paul road for our little town.</p>

<p>“The position was a sinecure in a way, but I
captured an occasional accident case that paid
something, and the position of surgeon to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
railroad gave me a certain amount of prestige
among the country folk around. Then too,
I had an annual pass over the road, and that
helped some. It would have helped more
if I had had time to ride and money for meals
on the dining cars. Small though my railroad
practice was, however, I had occasion to thank
the Lord that I was a railroad surgeon and that
one of my patients had a good memory, before I
was done with the job.</p>

<p>“The winter of ’80 and ’81 was a hard one,
and practice was not a simple, lightsome game.
It seemed to me that when I had important
work to do, my patient was always a long way
off in some out of the way farm house, or at a
crossing station where the trains ran every
other week.</p>

<p>“The day before Christmas I received a call
to attend a gunshot injury, about fifty miles
from my home. The weather was abominable,
being cold and stormy enough to make the
hungriest and most ambitious young surgeon
hesitate to face it. They get the blizzards
from that devilish Medicine Hat at first hand
up there, you, know—the raw stuff in the way
of weather. But needs must when patients
called, and as there was nothing to do but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
face the music I took the first and only available
train for X——.</p>

<p>“My patient lived some miles away from the
little hen coop of a station, the several stores
and half a dozen houses that constituted the
little town. A couple of young country yokels,
eighteen or twenty years of age, met me at the
train with a buck-board. There was just snow
enough drifting to make the roads almost
impassable here and there, but not enough for
sleighing, so that the trip was not the pleasantest
I had ever experienced.</p>

<p>“It was supper time before I had finished
with the wounded man, and I was as hungry
as a Sioux Indian on a long trail in the Bad
Lands. I was very glad to participate in the
humble but abundant meal.</p>

<p>“Supper over, I was informed that there
was just time to catch the south bound train—then
to the buckboard and miserable roads
again; the gawky country boys who had met
me at the train still doing the honors. When
we arrived at the station, what was my disgust
to learn that my train was fully two hours late.</p>

<p>“The prospect of spending the entire evening
at a little tumble down way station waiting for
a belated train was too uninviting for adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
description. As the storm was increasing every
moment and the fierce wind was piling up the
snow drifts higher and higher across the railroad
tracks, there was no certainty that the expected
train would come at all. My prospects for getting
home that night were certainly dubious—locomotives
stalled in snow drifts were sufficiently
familiar to me to make me decidedly
uneasy.</p>

<p>“My friends, the country boys, seeing my
predicament, offered to stay with me until the
train came, and although I protested feebly
against their discommoding themselves to such
an extent, I inwardly rejoiced when they
showed their sincerity by insisting on remaining.
Alas! had I but known the horrible thing that
was soon to happen, I should have returned to
their home with them rather than to have
allowed the poor fellows to indulge their whole-souled
notions of courtesy and hospitality.</p>

<p>“A cheery fire was burning in the stuffy little
drum stove in the center of the common waiting
room, and being pretty well chilled after our
long, weary ride, I huddled up as close to it as
I could without igniting my clothing. The
two young farmers meanwhile inaugurated a
playful wrestling bout which answered well in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
lieu of the fire in starting up their circulation.</p>

<p>“In one corner of the room was a curtained
recess, containing the station master’s bed, to
which the owner had apparently retired early,
as evidenced by the brassy, nasally whistling
snores which from time to time rent the air of
the stuffy apartment, making the environment
rather cheerful and homelike.</p>

<p>“I had been warming myself before the fire
for fully an hour—the country lads had grown
tired of their rough play and had seated themselves
on a rough bench in the corner of the
room, where they were nodding and occasionally
snoring an intermittent, shrill falsetto accompaniment
to the station master’s ruder and less
musical bass. I had just discovered that I
myself was growing sleepy and was about to
seat myself with my back to the wall, yield to
the pressure of fatigue and join the sleeping
chorus when I was brought back to earth in a
very unceremonious fashion.</p>

<p>“‘Hands up, there!’</p>

<p>“I turned slowly and gazed sleepily in the direction
of the voice. The two country youths
awoke with a start and sat staring, more stupidly
than I if possible, in the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
“‘Hands up, there, and be d—d quick about
it!’</p>

<p>“I began to comprehend, and my hands,
impelled by a will which for the time being was
more masterly than my own, raised themselves,
almost automatically, straight up in the air in
the most orthodox fashion known to the annals
of highway robbery. The country boys rose
slowly to their feet and mechanically followed
suit.</p>

<p>“The sleep-fog and the psychic confusion of
surprise gradually cleared away, and I saw the
tableau clearly—so clearly that, ‘an’ I should
live a thousand years I’d not forget it’.</p>

<p>“Standing in the open door of the little station
were two tough looking men. The taller of the
two, the owner of the voice that had so unmusically
and ruthlessly aroused us, was a man
considerably over six feet in height, raw-boned,
broad-shouldered, big-hatted, and roughly
dressed, with a coarse red beard that evidently
was much the worse for wear in regions where
barbers are a scarce commodity. His eyes were
of that cold steely grey color which makes one
think twice before running counter to the wishes
of the man to whom they belong.</p>

<p>“The ruffian held in either hand a cow boy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
pet, a long barreled Colt’s 45—the kind our
fathers loved; the kind that has made American
history, and especially the ‘bad men’ who
adorn its pages.</p>

<p>“Say, old man, did you ever have a healthy,
well favored, full stomached Colt’s 45 pointed
at you in real earnest? Well, if you haven’t
you can’t appreciate how I felt. I didn’t have
to see that the hammers of those particular
guns were raised to the proper angle and ready
for business; it was also entirely unnecessary
to waste any valuable time in speculating as
to whether they were loaded or not. I actually
<em>felt</em> that those guns were at full cock and loaded
to the muzzle—‘chock a block’. The muzzles of
the weapons were more capacious than I had
believed it possible for pistols to be, and deep
down in each of their yawning throats I fancied
I could see a huge conical ball, ready for flight
in my direction. It was as though I were tied
hand and foot and laid upon the track at the
mouth of a railroad tunnel from which an
express train was thundering down upon me at
the rate of a mile a minute.</p>

<p>“Not knowing anything of the desperado’s
power of self-control my own self-possession was
hard to maintain—I imagined that his fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
were a little trembly, as though he were tempted
to pull the trigger and have done with it, but
was struggling with himself in the effort to restrain
the savage impulse. I mentally resolved
that I would neither do nor say anything which
should disturb his poise or ruffle his equanimity.</p>

<p>“Ugh! I could actually hear the rush of
the displaced air and impelling gases as the
bullets started from their hiding places in the
breeches of those mighty pistols and, swifter
than lightning, flew toward me. I even fancied
I could feel the impact of the cruel missiles
with my flesh, and the moist warmth of the
escaping blood as they rent my skin and muscles.</p>

<p>“Our hands being elevated to an angle which
was satisfactory to the spokesman of the
bandits, he turned to his companion and said:</p>

<p>“‘Go through ’em, Bob, and hustle it up.
The train’ll be here before we can say Jack
Robinson. Take that feller with the whiskers
an’ spectacles first. Easy, now, gents; take
your medicine, and don’t you bat an eye—if
you don’t want a hole plugged through ye
big enough for a cat to crawl into without
bloodyin’ her whiskers.’</p>

<p>“The fellow who was officiating as lieutenant
for the gentleman with the artillery was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
tough-looking proposition for his inches, but
such a little runt that even the moral suasion
of the 45’s did not blunt the edge of my humiliation
when he proceeded to ‘go through’ me.</p>

<p>“But the ignominy and shame of my embarrassing
position had not yet reached the climax.
I was raging inwardly and wishing that I could
have a fair field and no favor with either or
both of the bandits—I used to be pretty handy
myself, you know—but I did not lose my self-control
during the dextrous and speedy search
of my person. A pair of walloping big guns
is a great inhibitor of the warlike spirit.</p>

<p>“I had not collected my fee in the gunshot
case, hence the process of ‘going through’ me
was not very productive of spoils. My pockets
were as empty of cash as those of a lamb after
a busy day on ‘Change. A Waterbury watch,
about two dollars in small change, a not very
elaborate set of surgical instruments, a jack-knife,
a bunch of keys, my wife’s photograph,
and an annual pass on the St. Paul road constituted
my available assets.</p>

<p>“The robber was simply furious when he took
account of stock. Dashing the stuff upon the
floor he ripped out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
“‘D—n you for a no account cuss, anyhow!
I’ll just give you one for luck.’</p>

<p>“With this the ruffian suddenly caught me
by the shoulders and, wheeling me to the right
about, kicked me full upon the pride center!
What little weight the fellow had was in that
kick and I recollect that the hurt to my anatomy
and the still greater injury to my self-respect
was not unmingled with surprise. I never
before knew how hard such a little chap could
kick. It was like a blow from a hydraulic ram.
It jarred me so that a plate with several false
upper teeth was dislodged from my mouth, and
fell upon the floor.</p>

<p>“The kick the bandit had given me was alone
sufficient to impel me to do murder—my breed
does not placidly submit to blows—but the
betrayal of a secret which I had guarded carefully,
even from my wife, was the last straw
in my burden of humiliation. I could take a
bite of crow, but I could not bolt him, beak,
claws, feathers and all. So enraged was I that
I completely forgot the man behind the guns.</p>

<p>“In the rear of the stove was a shelf upon
which stood numerous things essential to even
a bachelor’s housekeeping. Among these various
properties a brace of old fashioned flat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
irons caught my eye. I rushed to the shelf,
grabbed an iron and hurled it at my enemy’s
head, just missing him by a hair’s breadth.</p>

<p>“Whether because he was taken by surprise
or not, I do not know, but the bandit made no
attempt to draw a weapon. He stood with
mouth agape, stupidly gazing at me until,
having missed my aim with the iron, I rushed at
him like an infuriated bull; he then aroused
himself to the emergency and clinched for
safety, and we went to the floor together, the
highwayman underneath. As I went down I
caught a glimpse of the station agent with a six
shooter in his hand, peering cautiously out
between the curtains of the partition behind
which he had been sleeping, apparently seeking
an opportunity for a pot shot.</p>

<p>“With the downfall of the nearer robber the
country boys regained their power of motion—and
alas! forgot those awful guns and rushed
awkwardly to my assistance.</p>

<p>“The desperado with the guns came into
action simultaneously with the farmer lads.
There were two shots, so close together that
there seemed to be but one report! The two
unfortunate youths fell dead across us two who
were struggling upon the floor, their blood spouting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
over me in hot gushes. They fell with
their full weight crushing me, so inertly that I
was compelled to heave them off with my shoulders
and elbows.</p>

<p>“The murder of those poor boys brought me
to my senses, and then came an acute realization
of the imminence of my own danger—I
well knew at whom the next shot would be
fired. With the realization of my danger my
furious anger vanished; I regained my usual
presence of mind and my thinking apparatus
began to work again.</p>

<p>“Putting in practice a trick well known on the
wrestling mat, I threw one arm around the neck
of my foe, choking him into absolute helplessness.
With the other arm I rolled him over
like a trussed Christmas turkey, so that his body
was between me and the danger of a salute from
the 45’s. As I turned him over a shot rang out.
The ball narrowly escaped putting an end to the
battle. It was a lucky shot for me in more ways
than one—it not only missed me, but struck the
stove, ricocheted and smashed the hanging-lamp
with which the room was dimly lighted.
There was now no light save from the open door
of the stove.</p>

<p>“The man with the guns, still bent upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
assisting his friend and incidentally exterminating
me, at once came to close quarters.
Standing over our struggling forms, he endeavored
to put a shot where it would do his cause
the most good. He shot twice, but fired wide,
so great was his fear of hitting his confederate.</p>

<p>“Never was my mind or muscle more active.
I thought of the station master and his six
shooter. ‘My God! Will he never fire?’ I
exclaimed mentally. Meanwhile I twisted my
helpless foe about like a bundle of rags. From
side to side I rolled him—always with a view
to keeping his body between me and danger.
Suddenly there was a blinding flash, fairly in
my face—and then came oblivion!</p>

<p>“How long I lay insensible I have no means of
knowing. When I recovered consciousness I
found myself lying where I had fallen when I
went to the floor with the highwayman. Beside
me, so near that I could touch them with my
hand, lay the dead bodies of my late companions.
I could just discern their rigid outlines in the
dim light from the stove.</p>

<p>“As my senses grew more acute I became
aware of an intense burning pain in the left side
of my head, and felt a stream of warm fluid
which I at once recognized as blood, trickling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
freely down my face. I touched the painful
spot with my fingers, and knew at once what
had happened—I had been shot through the
temple! The serious nature of the injury
would have suggested itself to the merest tyro.
You may imagine how I felt, knowing as you do
the extensive experience I had had with gunshot
wounds. There did not seem to be one
chance in a hundred that the ball had failed
to penetrate my brain. Realizing this, I was
only too well aware of the probably desperate
character of my wound.</p>

<p>“I tried to rise, and after several painful
efforts succeeded in raising myself on my elbow,
only immediately to fall helplessly back to the
floor again. As I lay there half dazed, and fearfully
exhausted from the shock and loss of
blood, I realized in a hazy sort of way that there
was nothing to do but await the coming of
assistance.</p>

<p>“I recalled in a confused fashion the vision of
the station master and his gun, and wondered
what had become of him and why he had not
fired at the bandits during the fight. That he
had fled from the scene of battle did not occur
to me. It subsequently transpired, however,
that the gallant fellow was too frightened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
fire at the desperadoes and that, after several
attempts to muster up courage enough to pull
the trigger on them, he had dropped his weapon
and fled incontinently through a rear window.</p>

<p>“I finally became apathetic and indifferent
as to my fate—an experience by no means
unusual to persons who have suffered from
shock and great loss of blood—and lapsed into
almost complete unconsciousness.</p>

<p>“How long I lay there upon the floor in my
half dead condition is a matter for conjecture.
I was finally aroused to full consciousness by
the sound of voices and the noise of many feet
at the door of the station. I heard some one
say:</p>

<p>“‘I don’t think they both got away, boys.
I only seen one feller run. Perhaps one o’ them
men they was holdin’ up got one of ’em; there
was a hull lot o’ shootin’ goin’ on.’</p>

<p>“‘We’d better go kind o’ careful, then,’ said
another. ‘If there’s any of ’em in there, they
may have just one kick left in ’em.’</p>

<p>“In my confused state of mind the significance
of what I heard was entirely lost upon me. I
knew only that help was at hand and felt that
I must get to it.</p>

<p>“Struggling to my feet by a mighty effort I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
tottered to the door through which the feeble
rays of a lantern in the hands of one of the crowd
were gleaming. Reaching the door, I stumbled
over the threshold and fairly fell into the arms
of several men who were apparently too startled
to follow the example of the rest of the crowd,
which had scattered the instant my form
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“I was immediately thrown to the ground and
pinned there by a big strapping fellow, who in
his excitement very nearly finished the bandit’s
work by squeezing what little breath I had
remaining completely out of me.</p>

<p>“‘I’ve got him, boys!’ cried the man, who I
afterward learned was the station master. The
crowd recovered its nerve, returned to action
and proceeded to inspect the capture, apparently
losing all interest in further investigation of
conditions inside the station.</p>

<p>“In the crowd were several women, who,
with the curiosity and enterprise characteristic
of the “weaker” sex in mobs, succeeded in pushing
themselves in front of the men. As the
man with the lantern turned the light full upon
me, there was a cry from one of the women.</p>

<p>“‘That’s him, that’s the big robber! I seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
him through the winder of our house when they
passed by. I’d know him anywhere!’</p>

<p>“I began to realize that I was in danger and,
fully aroused, endeavored to make myself heard.
My efforts were futile, however, and I merely
received a choking for my pains.</p>

<p>“‘Let’s string him up, boys; it’ll save the
county a lot of expense!’ shouted some one.</p>

<p>“‘Hang him! Hang him!’ chorused the
crowd.</p>

<p>“‘Somebody get a rope!’ cried the man who
was kneeling on my chest.</p>

<p>“‘Take him to a telegraph pole!’ cried another.</p>

<p>“I was half dragged, half carried to the
nearest telegraph pole and assisted to my feet
beneath it. A rope was speedily found and
tied about my neck. A boy was ordered to
climb the pole with the other end of the rope
and pass it over the arm that supports the wires.</p>

  <img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“A ROPE WAS SPEEDILY FOUND AND TIED ABOUT MY NECK”</div></div>

<p>“My situation would not have been so bad if
I had lost the power of thinking and with it
the capacity for mental suffering. My mind
was never so acute as at that moment but,
with the treatment the bandits had given me
and the mauling and choking I had since
received at the hands of that ignorant mob, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
had absolutely lost my power of speech. But
think!—My God! man, of what did I not think,
as I stood there in the shadow of death at the
hands of a lot of ignorant farmers and railroad
hands who were about to offer me up on the
altar of their own cowardice and brutality? A
mob feels but it does not reason. I had seen
enough of mobs to know that only a miracle
could save me.</p>

<p>“It is a trite observation that in the mind
of one standing on the margin of the Valley of
Shadows, as I was at that awful moment, all
the events of his past life pass in swift review.
So rapidly does one impression follow another,
that one’s previous experiences form a single
composite picture like that of the biograph, or
the pictures that dreams paint upon the brain.
Such was my own experience in a general way,
but one feature of the mental life review which
my terrible experience brought me was most
peculiar and horrifying.</p>

<p>“For several years before I graduated in
medicine, I occupied a position in the coroner’s
office in the city of C——. In the performance
of my official duties I was compelled to witness
a number of executions. Among others was
that of a certain wife murderer. The sheriff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
usually expert in such matters, made a bungle
of this man’s case. The noose slipped and
he slowly strangled to death! The unhappy
event made a most powerful impression upon
my youthful mind, but I little thought of the
mental rehearsal of the awful scene that was
in store for me.</p>

<p>“Standing out in bold relief from the rest of
the picture of my past life that was displayed
before my mental vision as the mob completed
its preparations for hanging me, was the frightful
scene enacted on the gallows at the execution
of the wife murderer in the jail yard of C——.</p>

<p>“The most peculiar feature of it all was that
it was I, and not that wife murderer whose
death throes I saw in my mind’s eye. Horrible
beyond conception were that awful choking,
the agonized struggle for breath, the tumultuous
spasms of the diaphragm, the twitchings of
the muscles and the frightful roaring in the
ears which I experienced as the murderer
slowly died of strangulation. As the limbs
of the dying man in the mental picture spasmodically
flexed and extended themselves, I
felt all of the agonizing pains experienced by
sufferers from lock jaw or strychnine poisoning.</p>

<p>“And this was not all. My chest was encircled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
as with a band of iron. Closer and closer
drew the band until it seemed as if my diaphragm
must tear clear across its breadth in
the fearful effort to get oxygen into my lungs.
I saw brilliant, glittering points and shafts of
light dancing before my eyes. I seemed to be
growing delirious and vainly tried to speak, the
result being a queer sort of gibberish. Worst of
all, the black death hood seemed suddenly to
become transformed into a mask of transparent
glass, through which I could see my own purpling,
swollen features, with the bulging, blackened
lips and protruding tongue and turgid,
popping eye balls, in which I could see the horror
of impending death reflected. Oh, it was
horrible! horrible!</p>

<p>“As the struggling body in the picture swayed
back and forth from the initial tipping movement
imparted by the falling of the drop, my
real body seemed to oscillate back and forth
like a pendulum. Once, when the picture
body struck with cruel impact a corner post
of the gallows tree, an acute, agonizing pain
shot through me from head to foot. Then
the swaying movement ceased and the body
spun round and round like a top at the end of
the fatal cord, so rapidly that the fuzzy threads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
of the hemp stood out like a coating of fur upon
the rope. I grew dizzy and nauseated. Dizzier
and dizzier I grew; louder and yet louder
grew the roaring in my ears, until I became
unconscious and—all was over.</p>

<p>“Then came the most incomprehensible thing
of all. I recovered consciousness and saw
crowding around the dead body upon the
scaffold the lookers on at the execution, and
the coroner’s jury, with myself at its head.
Standing beside the corpse was Dr. Cartwright,
the coroner’s physician. Watch in hand, with
his fingers on the wrist of the corpse seeking
for signs of the life that had forever departed,
the doctor slowly counted the minutes required
by law.</p>

<p>“And then I saw the body lowered into the
coffin and taken away!</p>

<p>“All that I have described to you took place
very rapidly. I was not conscious of any
appreciable interval between the time of my
conveyance from the station by the mob and
the final act of the execution which my memory
had painted for me.</p>

<p>“While the drama of the hanging was being
played in my mind, the preparations for a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
tangible execution under the auspices of Judge
Lynch were going on.</p>

<p>“The boy with the rope ‘shinned’ up the
telegraph pole like a young monkey. Arriving
at the first cross arm of the pole, he passed the
rope over it and threw the loose end down to the
expectant crowd of bloodthirsty savages below.</p>

<p>“When the free end of the rope struck the
ground, the entire crowd, with the exception
of two or three men who were holding me,
rushed for it, and fought for holds upon it.
Each was more than willing to do his share in
the killing of their helpless victim.</p>

<p>“The falling of the rope’s end and the mad
rush of the crowd to secure it broke the spell
in which I was bound and I regained my voice
sufficiently to indistinctly mumble my name.
A few seconds more and my death by strangulation
would have been more than a mental
picture—it would have been a grim reality!
One of my guards had sufficient sense—or
curiosity, I don’t know which, nor do I care so
long as it served me well—to call a halt in the
ceremonies.</p>

<p>“‘Hold on, boys! Wait a minute—let’s hear
what this feller’s tryin’ to say. We’ve got
plenty of time to hear his spiel.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
“Most of the crowd came reluctantly back
to listen. The more ravenously bloodthirsty
of the mob still held on to the rope and waited
impatiently for the continuation of the pleasure
party. As the brutes crowded around me I
managed to introduce myself a little more
coherently.</p>

<p>“‘Go on, what yer givin’ us?’ said the
man who had halted the execution; ‘He says
he’s a doctor, boys’.</p>

<p>“‘Here, let’s have a look at that feller,’ cried
a voice from somewhere in the crowd. A man
pressed forward and confronted me.</p>

<p>“‘Gimme that lantern.’</p>

<p>“The lantern was handed to him, and holding
it close to my face he looked at me earnestly
for a moment. I in turn, as you may surmise,
stared quite as hard at him. We recognized
each other simultaneously!</p>

<p>“‘Dan Williams,’ I stammered weakly, recognizing
an old patient of mine, a railroad hand
whose leg I had saved after it had been condemned
to amputation.</p>

<p>“‘Good God! Doc. Fairweather, is that you?’</p>

<p>“I was saved! I shall always believe that
the majority of the mob felt aggrieved at both
Dan and myself by the mutual recognition that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
had saved my life by such a narrow margin.
The rope was dropped, however, albeit grudgingly,
and my neck released from its gruesome
embrace.</p>

<p>“Dan impressed several of his friends into
service and I was taken to the nearest house
and temporarily cared for as well as possible
under my own rather wabbly and uncertain
direction, whilst I told my story as best I could
in my pitiful condition.</p>

<p>“It was several days before I could be moved,
a local physician meanwhile ministering to me
with more devotion than surgical skill. You
may imagine how happy I was to learn that my
head was so hard that it had not been feazed by
a 45 calibre conical ball. The bullet had entered
my head at the left temple, glancing around
the skull, plowing a huge furrow in the scalp and
cutting a groove in the outer table of the bone
along which it left a trail of lead clear around
to the occiput, whence it had been deflected.
It was afterward found buried in the wall of
the station and sent to me as a souvenir.</p>

<p>“After my return home I was seriously ill
for several weeks. I finally, however, returned
to my practice, a little the worse for wear, but
grateful for my hard-headedness. It was some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
time before my brain worked with its usual
alertness, but after a few months I had only the
scar to remind me of a most awful experience.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“And now for the story of the skull:</p>

<p>“A strong posse was organized for the pursuit
of the murderers and they were soon overtaken,
after a running fight some miles north of the
scene of the awful tragedy in which I had
enacted such an important rôle.</p>

<p>“The bandits had entrenched themselves in
a deserted farm house, from which they made
a desperate fight against their pursuers. Several
of the attacking party were killed or
wounded. During a lull in the fighting the
smaller of the two desperados deserted his comrade,
escaped from the house, and ran for the
timber. A clever chap who had secreted himself
in the woods at the rear of the house in
anticipation of some such move on the part
of the murderers, received him with a huge
charge of buckshot from both barrels of a shot
gun fired at close range, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>“I have a picture of the result of the shot,
taken as the dead outlaw lay in his coffin.
In my leisure moments I comfort myself by
gazing upon it. Through the agency of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
photograph the humiliation of the kick the
fellow administered to me has faded into the
faintest of memories. Indeed, when I do
chance to recall that particular incident of
the tragedy in which I played so prominent
a part, it is with amusement rather than with
chagrin.</p>

<p>“The principal of the two outlaws finally
exhausted his ammunition. The house was
rushed, and after a desperate hand to hand
battle, in which, as the sheriff afterwards told
me, the desperado ‘made plenty good, and laid
out’ several of the attacking party, he was
overpowered and manacled.</p>

<p>“The captured bandit proved to be Jack
McDougall—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nom de guerre</i>, ‘Reddy McDug’—a
many times murderer, bank robber and all
round ‘bad man,’ upon whose head a price
had rested for many months.</p>

<p>“McDougall was taken to K——, the county
seat, and placed in jail under a strong guard.
He was speedily tried, convicted and sentenced
to be hanged.</p>

<p>“During the trial, the desperado and I became
very well acquainted, and before the date
set for the execution I am free to say that I
had become sufficiently interested in him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
rather regret the impending cessation of our
relations. Indeed, I am not ashamed to confess
that I finally conceived a warm regard for the
poor devil. Call it a whim if you like, the
fact remains that I really did like him.</p>

<p>“Whatever else he may have been, Reddy
was not a coward, and if there is any one
thing I admire more than another in a man
it is gameness. McDougall was a moral imbecile—he
considered that he had followed a
vocation, and a rather decent one, but he
knew the price of the game and was willing
to pay it if needs must. He said to me at one
of my numerous visits:</p>

<p>“‘You see, Doc, it all depends on how you’re
born, and how the cards is stacked. No matter
what kind of a game you play, an’ no matter
how you play it, settlin’ time is bound to
come sooner or later. I’d like to sit in the
hold up game a little longer, ’cause I’m still
able-bodied, but I dunno as it makes a h—ll of
a lot of difference when a feller’s hand is called.
Anyhow, what’s the use o’ kickin’? Mine’s
been called all right, all right, and there you
are.’</p>

<p>“I last saw McDougall the day before his
execution. He was still game as a pebble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
His principal concern was to have me witness
his end. Said he:</p>

<p>“‘Now, Doc, you an’ me has got to be
pretty good pals, even if I did plug you
that time tryin’ to help my pardner—which
was part of the game anyway. You’re all
the friend I’ve got, and I’d like to have you
present at the swingin’ party. Just come
and watch me cash in, an’ see how nice an’
gentlemanly your friend Reddy ‘ll take his
medicine. There’ll be nary a kick out o’ me
before the bottom drops out of things, an’
nary a kick afterward, if Mr. Sheriff’s onto his
job.’</p>

<p>“I saw that McDougall was in earnest, and
assured him as I bade him good-bye that I
would be on hand for the ceremony. But,
all the same, I didn’t mean a word of it. I had
had about all the experience with hangings,
both as witness and prospective principal,
that was necessary to satisfy a man of my
modest desires. Why, I had myself actually
been mentally hanged and nearly physically
hanged simultaneously. Besides, as I have
already said, I liked McDougall.</p>

<p>“The execution came off according to schedule,
and I was greatly consoled by the report<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
that the sheriff, was, as McDougall expressed
it, decidedly ‘on to his job.’ Indeed, I was
told that the hanging was as smooth a piece
of work as had ever occurred in Minnesota.
So smooth was it, and so agreeable to the sentiments
of the population of that section of
the State, that the re-election of Sheriff Jackson
was a foregone conclusion. All of which shows
that the artist in his particular line is not without
appreciation, and that the executioner,
unlike the prophet, getteth honor in his own
country.</p>

<p>“There were no friends to claim the body
of the dead outlaw, and it finally found its
way to the M—— Medical College. The demonstrator
of anatomy, who chanced to be a warm
friend of mine, knew the circumstances under
which I had become acquainted with the late
Mr. McDougall, and reasoning that I would
be very glad to receive a souvenir commemorative
of the strenuous introduction to that
distinguished gentleman which I had received,
dissected the head with especial care, and after
thorough preparation and skillful bleaching
sent the gruesome object to me with his
compliments. Since the reception of the skull
my lamented friend in material bone and ethereal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
spirit has been the presiding genius of
my den—a friend in whom I have full confidence,
because I can trust him, and an enemy
whom I no longer dread, because I have him
where all of our enemies should be placed—in
a collection of curios. Rather a nice skull,
isn’t it?”</p>

<h2 id="A_WISE_CHILD">A WISE CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p>I was enjoying my after dinner cigar, and
thinking, with some amusement, of a remark
my little daughter had made. During the
afternoon she had been taken by a party of my
friends to a museum—a great treat for her, as
she is of an inquiring turn of mind. Among
the curiosities and freaks on exhibition, was
a poor fellow who was afflicted with some
nervous affection that impelled him to keep
constantly in motion. The child was especially
impressed with the fact that the man was
unable to sit down. The grown-up folks of
the party were greatly puzzled by the curious
phenomenon—not so my hopeful. Looking
at him carefully and with an expression of most
profound pity for a few moments, she exclaimed,
“Poor man! What an awful lot of spankings
he must have had when he was a little boy!”</p>

<div id="ip_216" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">“A WISE CHILD”</div></div>

<p>“Well,” I thought, “children are keen observers
after all. It might be interesting to read
the thoughts of some of them. Now, there’s
that Smith baby for example—what a wise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
expression it has, to be sure! Really, that child
ought to be called Solomon. I would suggest
the name to <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pater familias</i>, only he might get
frightened at the mere suggestion of such
wisdom on the part of his offspring.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Smith child is the
most remarkable specimen of a young one I
have ever seen. He is now some three years of
age, yet has never made the slightest attempt to
talk. As for walking, I question whether the
child will ever be able to use his limbs very
successfully. They are malformed and very
imperfectly developed. But the child’s head
has gone to the other extreme; while by no
means symmetrical in outline, it is preternaturally
large, with bulging frontal eminences
and immense parietal protuberances. The eyes
are brilliant, deep set, and reflect an expression
of wise gravity that is positively eerie. The
brow is wrinkled in strongly marked furrows
and the general aspect of the face is somewhat
shrivelled and prematurely old. Around the
angles of the mouth are converging, plainly
accentuated lines that give the face an expression
of sternness. There is no color in the skin
save about the eyelids, which are habitually
red and tumefied. The dead, clayey whiteness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of the child’s complexion is occasionally relieved
by dark, blotchy eruptions, that make the
unhealthy pallor of the skin still more noticeable.</p>

<p>The most striking peculiarity of the Smith
baby is its prematurely aged look, suggesting
the grotesque combination of the face of a sickly
old man with the body of a child. At first
sight, the effect is somewhat startling.</p>

<p>And yet, despite its physical defects, the child
grows on. Knowing how utterly defenseless
the poor little thing was against the circumstances
which made it a caricature of healthy
babyhood, and realizing its abject helplessness
in the battle of life, I sincerely pity it.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that mothers lavish so much
affection upon such children as the Smith baby?
No matter how many beautiful children she
may have, the heart of the mother goes out to
the least favored of her offspring in a wealth of
love that is the only excuse the unfortunate
child has for living. Mothers care naught for
the law of the survival of the fittest—not they.
Should such a child die, the poor mother mourns
it as the one ewe lamb of her little flock.</p>

<p>With the father it is different, somehow—perhaps
not in all cases, but I know it is different
with the father in this instance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
Smith is a queer sort of fellow—rather reticent
in manner it seems to me. However, he is a
new patron of mine and perhaps I do not quite
understand him. I was first called in to see
the baby, and haven’t had very much opportunity
to converse with the father. At the
present rate of progress, I am not likely to get
much better acquainted, for, come to think of
it, he seems somewhat inclined to avoid me.</p>

<p>But Smith’s friends say that he is a thoroughly
good fellow; indeed, that he is “one of the boys.”</p>

<p>Once in a while, Smith seems to be more than
ordinarily anxious about the baby—apparently
through pride rather than affection, for the
little one really seems to be the bane of his
existence. He did unbend once, enough to ask
me if there wasn’t some way to cure the child’s
snuffles and keep “those d—d blotches” off its
face, but I am sure he was thinking more of the
comments of his neighbors than of the child’s
comfort.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that Smith cares a straw about
his young one’s digestion, yet he swore like a
pirate when he saw the irregular manner in
which its second teeth were coming in. Not
that I blame him much for swearing, for those
teeth do look more like those of a saw than such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
as a baby of good breeding is expected to
develop. Still, the child is not to blame for his
bad teeth. Smith knows that, if he knows
anything.</p>

<p>I suppose I ought not to say it, but I honestly
believe that Smith would far rather his child
would die than live. The poor little thing had
a bad attack of cholera infantum a while ago,
and narrowly missed going to the land where
babies’ stomachs are at rest and pimples are
unknown. It is a dreadful thing to say, but
I really suspect that Smith was—well, not
exactly pleased with the results of my treatment.
He made a remark the other day that
was suggestive, to say the least. He said there
were too many new-fangled ideas in the treatment
of children’s diseases to suit him. “Toxins,”
said he, “were invented, I suppose, to
cover up medical ignorance.”</p>

<p>I did not reply, for, as I have already remarked,
Smith and I have not become very
friendly as yet.</p>

<p>But the Smith baby is a very interesting
study, and I can tolerate its father’s peculiar
ways for the child’s sake, and for the interest
the case affords me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
I lolled back in my favorite chair puffing the
fragrant smoke in fantastic rings, carelessly
aimed at the chandelier overhead, and revolving
the case of the Smith baby in my mind. I do
not know how long I sat there musing, but I
finally fell into that half dreamy state which,
with me, is a positive sign of an impending nap.
Even my cigar was becoming sleepy and had
begun to smolder. Being in no mood to tolerate
interruption, I fear it was with some irritation
that I shouted, in response to a timid rap at the
door:</p>

<p>“Come in!”</p>

<p>The door opened, and in walked—Smith’s
baby!</p>

<p>To say that I was astonished would be quite
conventional, but measurably untrue, for—I
was paralyzed. I think my visitor must have
noticed the effect his unexpected entrance had
upon me, for, after a deferential bow and a polite
“Good evening,” he calmly awaited my
pleasure. There was a quizzical expression
in his eyes, and a pitying smile animated his
curiously wrinkled face as I finally stammered:</p>

<p>“W—why, g—good evening, sir. This is
quite—quite, ah—unexpected, you know.”</p>

<p>“And also unconventional, I presume,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
my caller. “It is not <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en regle</i>, I believe, for
people who are helpless to call upon the doctor.
He is supposed to do all the calling himself.
Patients who have sound legs and strength
enough to walk are the only sort who are
expected to visit their medical adviser. We will
not consider those ‘has beens,’ who are sometimes
so grateful to the doctor for helping them
out of the world that they call upon him afterward
o’ nights,” and the baby smiled sarcastically.</p>

<p>I do not believe in ghosts, yet I must confess
that I blushed hotly at the implied unfair criticism
of my noble profession.</p>

<p>My young friend noticed my confusion and
said:</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I did not mean to be personal.
There are doctors and doctors you know—and
also spooks and things.”</p>

<p>“Great Hippocrates!” I exclaimed, springing
to my feet in sudden, amazed recollection. “I
thought you could neither walk nor talk, and
you have not only come to see me but are talking
as fluently as any one could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” replied my visitor, “things are
not always what they seem—even to doctors.
I have not walked much as yet, it is true, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
I thought it best not to do so. My limbs have
never looked very promising, and consequently
nothing has ever been expected of them. It
is much easier to ride or be carried about than
to walk—even with good legs—so I let the sympathy
of the people about me have full sway.</p>

<p>“As for speaking, pray tell me what inducement
there is to conversation in my case. I
am not fond of hearing myself talk—not at all,
and there’s no use talking to the people around
me. They could not understand me and there
are no subjects of mutual interest. Besides,
if I should display my linguistic skill, my folks
would be a little shy of me. They are very
confidential, you know, and on account of my
apparent inability to repeat what I hear, I get
in on many a nice bit of grown-up gossip.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “there does seem to be some
advantage in concealing your power of speech,
but I don’t quite comprehend your statement
that the people about you would not understand
you. Your language certainly seems clear
enough for ordinary understanding.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you see I have thus far been talking
in a quite commonplace fashion. We have
exchanged hardly more than mere conversational
greetings. With most persons the conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
would of necessity begin and end with
mere perfunctory remarks, and that wouldn’t
be worth while. You, however, being a doctor,
and consequently a man of learning, are capable
of appreciating me at my true value. I have
long experienced a desire to converse with you,
and to-night I resolved to call upon you here
at your own home, where we can have a little
chat without danger of interruption.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, smiling at his assurance, “but
how on earth have you acquired the information
necessary to carry on an intelligent conversation
with a scientific physician? You are only about
three years of age, and if you are as intellectual
as you claim to be, your precocity is certainly
marvelous.”</p>

<p>My little friend smiled blandly, and replied:
“That word, precocity, is a very offensive one,
but I excuse you for using it, because it is
evident that you do not know the true explanation
of the advanced intellect of the so-called
precocious child. Do you know anything of
Buddhism, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, something.”</p>

<p>“Then you will understand me when I say
that ‘precocity’ is merely the development in
the child of a portion of the wisdom acquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
during its previous terrestrial existences. As
you are aware, the modern school of theosophists
has appropriated this theory of the Buddhists.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” I replied, with some amusement,
“but that does not add to the validity of the
theory.”</p>

<p>“It is evident that you are not a theosophist,
doctor. I assure you, however, that the Buddhists
are right. I know they are right, for
I have myself been on earth twice before. You
have doubtless often noted that I am not as
other children.”</p>

<p>“True, you have always seemed much older
than your years,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then you are prepared to believe me when
I assert that what you have regarded as an
appearance of premature age, is merely a
reflection of my past lives showing through the
childlike envelopment of the present.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” I exclaimed, “there is certainly food
for reflection in what you say. I confess, however,
that the idea had never suggested itself
to me. I shall certainly make a note of it.”</p>

<p>My visitor seemed gratified at having imparted
such interesting and valuable information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
“And now, doctor, I am sure you will not
consider me egotistic if I claim to be, what my
appearance would indicate—a ‘wise child’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! Are you the original ‘wise child’
who knew his own father?” I asked, jocularly.</p>

<p>My young friend seemed to take me seriously,
and replied, “Pshaw! doctor; I am surprised
that you even remember that absurd theory.
There’s nothing in it, and besides, it’s a very
crude test of intellectuality. Why shouldn’t
any child who is not an idiot, know its own
father? Why, I was introduced to mine immediately
on my arrival in your inhospitable clime.
I remember the introduction more particularly,
because, not knowing what sort of people I was
to fall in with, I was quite afraid I might be
asked to step over and sit with the girls—a fate
too horrible to think of!</p>

<p>“Now, doctor, I suppose you are wondering
what I am going to find to talk about. I have
already informed you that platitudes and
conventional commonplaces are very fatiguing
to me. I assure you, however, that it is not
my intention to go to the other extreme and
talk abstract science.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” I exclaimed, “Do you mean
to say that you have had a scientific training?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
“Oh, my, yes!” replied young Smith, drawing
himself up—rather proudly it seemed to me.
“But,” he continued, “I am not going to enter
into the scientific heavies. I shall deal largely
in generalities, and such science as may appear
in my remarks will be of a rather superficial
sort.</p>

<p>“Since knowing you, doctor, I have become
quite reconciled to the death of your predecessor
in our family—dear old Dr. Whittemore.
He was a kind, considerate old man, and as
tender-hearted as a woman, despite his rough
ways. But I didn’t like him at first. You
see I didn’t understand him very well. He
had such a habit of swearing to himself whenever
he looked at these crooked legs of mine.
But he was my friend, nevertheless, and several
times when old Smith was—”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon,” I said, “but did you say,
old Smith?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” replied my visitor, raising his
eyebrows as though surprised at the interruption,
“old Smith—the governor, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see, you mean your father,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Of course I meant my father!” exclaimed
the youngster impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, continued the child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
several times when old Smith was especially
cross with me and the doctor happened to be
present, the old fellow took my part and told
the governor he ought to be ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“Smith once pointed at me and said, ‘Great
God! man, look at that head and those legs!
How can you blame me for being disgusted because
the little beast lived?’</p>

<p>“‘Now, see here, Smith,’ exclaimed the
doctor, ‘that young-one, so far as I am aware,
is in no wise responsible for the contour of his
legs or the bulginess of his cranium. You and
I have a theory regarding the cause of the baby’s
peculiarities, which lays the responsibility at
the door of one—’</p>

<p>“‘Sh!—’ said pa, ‘there is no necessity of your
being personal, and besides, my mother-in-law
is in the next room, and it is really foolish to
call her in counsel. She is troublesome enough
now. She looks suspiciously wise at times.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then,’ said the doctor, ‘don’t talk so
like a d—d fool!’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, there’s no use roasting me, doctor, I
am patient enough under the circumstances. I
sometimes think that if the medical profession
did its full duty, such children would not—’</p>

<p>“‘Would not live to a ripe old age, eh, Smith?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
interrupted the doctor, angrily. ‘Well, sir, the
profession of medicine is sometimes compelled
to save people from the consequences of their
crimes—it does not, however, feel in duty bound
to commit crimes for them. I trust the ethical
distinction between the duty of the profession
and the dirty work some persons would have it
do for them, is clear to your somewhat biased
intellect, my good sir!’</p>

<p>“My! but old Smith was mad—madder than a
hornet! But the doctor seemed to have the
better of the argument, and the governor soon
cleared out, grumbling to himself and swearing
at the cat that got in his way and had his tail
stepped on.”</p>

<p>“The old doctor certainly was your friend, and
I am not very favorably impressed by your description
of your father. I might say in passing,
however, that your lack of filial respect is a by
no means commendable trait in your character.
No matter what his peculiarities may be, you
must remember that Smith is your father and as
such demands respect. Have you forgotten
what the Bible says, ‘Honor thy father and thy
mother?’”</p>

<p>My young friend looked extremely disgusted,
and replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
“Dear me, doctor!—can’t you get along without
quoting such old, wormy, out-of-date authorities
as the Bible? That advice was all well
enough in its day, but honoring one’s parents in
the collective sense is played out in these modern
times. Mothers are just as much deserving of
honor as ever—and that’s a great deal, but fathers—humph!
The fellow who wrote that particular
portion of the scriptures didn’t know
Smith, you can just bet your bottom dollar on
that. If I was as big a fool as he thinks I am, I
might honor and respect him, but I know a
thing or two.</p>

<p>“Honor Smith? Ye gods! Look at the protuberances
of my cranium! Gaze upon these misshapen
legs of mine! You told my mother I had
‘rickets,’ didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ye—yes, I believe I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t blame you for your ignorance,
doctor. You have not been in practice long
enough to lose faith in human nature. Now,
old Dr. Whittemore knew better, and so does
Smith.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear boy,” I interposed, “I think I
know rachitis when I see it.”</p>

<p>“So, rachitis is the scientific appellation, eh?
Well, in the language of the street, ‘rachitis nothing!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Can’t you see through a millstone with a
hole in it? Doctor, my so-called rickets is
nothing more nor less than—”</p>

<p>“Hush! for the Lord’s sake, hush!” I cried,
putting my hand over young Smith’s mouth, as
a horrible suspicion suddenly flashed upon me.
“Be careful, my young friend, even the walls of
a doctor’s study may have ears. Can it be possible
that I have been mistaken and that—”</p>

<p>“Precisely so, sir,” interrupted my visitor sarcastically.
“You are really growing quite intelligent.
If you keep on, doctor, you will be
as good an intuitive diagnostician as we have in
Chicago, and that’s saying much.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied with some confusion, “but
you can’t expect a fellow to carry a divining rod
about with him, and besides, your family is one
of the highest respectability.”</p>

<p>My young visitor sneered perceptibly and retorted:</p>

<p>“Of course, you are like the rest of humanity,
looking for respectability in high places and overlooking
the pearls that lie imbedded in the mud
of poverty and social mediocrity. I really feel
inclined to lecture you, doctor, you seem so woefully
stupid in some directions. Here you are,
with abundant opportunities for study and observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
of human nature, maundering of ‘respectability’
as a factor in diagnosis! Not but
that it is a factor sometimes, but you don’t weigh
the evidence just right. You are inclined to
misconstrue social prominence as a factor in your
diagnoses. Your interpretation of it is only too
often precisely opposite to the truth.</p>

<p>“Look at the childlessness of the average high-toned
family—look at the character of the progeny
of those who do have children, and then
babble of ‘respectability!’ Faugh! doctor, you
make me sick. For a scientific physician, you
are the most innocent man I ever knew.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” I said, “I don’t pretend to
know it all, but I am not quite so big a fool as
you might suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps not—quite. There may be
bigger chumps, but I dare say they are all practicing
medicine.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” he continued, “speaking of
honoring one’s father, I can’t for the life of me
see why a fellow should be expected to do that.
Fathers are mere accidents in the scheme of nature.
You see, anybody will answer for a father,
but with your mother—well, that’s different. No
other could fill her place. Most people think
the male human is the important element in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
social system, but that’s all rot. He is a secondary
consideration, a mere incident, and should
be given to understand it.”</p>

<p>“Um-m ah!” I answered slowly, “I believe
the truth is gradually dawning upon him. The
new woman is—”</p>

<p>“Great guns, doctor! Do you mean those
things with breeches on, that ride bicycles, and
play foot ball?”</p>

<p>“Well, in a measure, yes,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Come, come, doctor! I was talking about
natural phenomena as involved in the perpetuation
of the species; I had no thought of what
biologists term sports in nature.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s different, my boy,” I said, “unless
you use the term ‘sport’ as a <em>double entendre</em>.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I quite understand you, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, I suppose my play upon words
was a little too commonplace for you,” I replied,
meanwhile thinking that the Smith baby,
was something of a chump himself. Not wishing
to hurt his feelings, however, I held my
peace, and he continued:</p>

<p>“Do you know, doctor, I think that if a
child is expected to honor its father, it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
have some voice in his selection. Now, for
example,” and the poor little chap felt of his
bumps and gazed mournfully at his crippled
limbs, “I should not have been as I am, had
I been permitted to select my father. Of
course I might have made a mistake, anyway,
but you can be assured that I should never
have selected Smith.”</p>

<p>“Well, Smith might not have been such
a bad father if—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you are going to say,
doctor, but no amount of preparatory treatment
would ever have made Smith anything
but a mean old cuss, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” I answered,
“and, come to think of it, as your family is
a comparatively new one to me, I believe I’ll
insist on monthly settlements of my bills.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know your own business better
than I do, but I know Smith pretty well, and I
don’t think it will do any harm,—unless he
gets mad and changes doctors. I hope he
won’t do that, for I am beginning to like you
pretty well, and I dread a change. There’s no
telling what these highly ‘respectable’ people
will do, you know, and now that you are beginning
to understand my case a little, a change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
of doctors might be disastrous. You see, I
can’t talk to everybody as freely as I feel that
I can to you.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I won’t send in any bill, it
would be too bad to neglect you, just because
your father is—”</p>

<p>“A brute, eh, doctor?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I shouldn’t like to say that,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Because of his eminent respectability, I
presume,” said my visitor, grinning sarcastically.</p>

<p>I was discreetly silent.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the young wiseacre, “I
don’t suppose that you and I alone could settle
a certain phase of the social problem, even
if we were foolish enough to try, but there are
some very interesting points that might be
discussed upon the question of that veneering
of ‘respectability’ for which you seem to have
such great reverence. I should like to discuss
them with you, did time permit. I assure
you that I have given the subject much conscientious
study and deep thought.</p>

<p>“There is one point, doctor, in which you
physicians are very remiss, and which, for the
sake of suffering childhood, I cannot allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
to pass unnoticed. I refer to the indiscriminate
fashion in which people are allowed to
marry, and rear children. Why, when I look
about me and see the number of infantile
wrecks, who, like myself, are victims of your
pernicious social system, I am disgusted. If
the principals in matrimonial mistakes were
the only ones to suffer, it would be different,
but it’s the babies that get the worst of it.
And you medical blockheads look on and say
nothing. You are too stupid to see anything,
perhaps, and therefore have nothing to say.”</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, you have the making of a
social reformer in you. I don’t know that I
ever gave the subject much thought. I have
been too busy with—”</p>

<p>“Too busy trying to cure results to inquire
into causes, eh, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Why, I—that is, not exactly,” I stammered,
“you know, my boy, that—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I understand, old fellow, you are
not quite blind to such things, but you don’t
propose either to pose as a Hercules cleaning
out the Augean stables, or expose yourself to
the same sort of ridicule as did Don Quixote
when he challenged the wind-mills. Shame on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
you, doctor! Be a good Philistine and snap
your fingers at conventionalities!”</p>

<p>“See here, my young friend, I am practicing
medicine for a livelihood, and I can’t afford
to be radical in my views. It’s all well enough
to scarify society, if you don’t depend upon
it for bread and butter—but in my case it’s different,
and I must be careful.”</p>

<p>Young Smith shrugged his shoulders somewhat
contemptuously, and replied:</p>

<p>“What a queer world! You fellows work
like a dog in a treadmill all your lives, trying
to make enough hay while the sun is shining,
to enable you to take some comfort by and
by. When the ‘by and by’ comes, you have
lost the capacity for enjoyment. You slave
from morning till night, to acquire a competency—and
the brains—that will enable you
to be independent in thought and action.
Then, when the wished-for time does come,
you—well, you roll over like a fish and die.
Always going to have a good time—some day;
always going to be a Philistine—some day;
always looking ahead into that undiscovered
country where lies—the grave. Your ambition
ends in six feet of earth. Pshaw! how you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
people irritate me! Why not learn to labor
and to loaf?”</p>

<p>My visitor’s words impressed me more than
I would have been willing to acknowledge.</p>

<p>“Heigho!” I exclaimed, “I don’t know but
you are right, my boy, and yet, I don’t exactly
see how I can help matters much.”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing you can do, doctor,
you can at least make the effort to impress
upon the public the necessity of treating human
beings with the same degree of intelligence
and consideration that you bestow upon animals.
Get rid of that idiotic, sentimental
moonshine about ‘joining two souls in wedlock’
and come down to the common-sense
basis of a union for a specific, organic purpose
between two bipeds, that are or should be,
subject to the same laws as other animals.
Do this and there will be fewer hideous heads
and miserable legs like mine.”</p>

<p>My little friend wept silently.</p>

<p>“Come, come, my lad, cheer up,” I said,
“You must remember that the ranks of the
immortal geniuses of the world have been
largely recruited from such material as yourself.”</p>

<p>“You doubtless mean to be consoling, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
dear sir,” replied the child, “but you forget
the chief consolation contained in your argument.”</p>

<p>“Pray, what is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why those degenerate geniuses die young,
and leave no posterity to perpetuate their
misery.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” I said, musingly. “I did
not think of that.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, doctor, that the most philosophic
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i> ever perpetrated, and the
one which seems most appropriate to my case,
is that facetious description which somebody
gave of the mule. He said, if I remember
correctly, that the mule was an animal which
had no ‘pride of paternity and no hope of posterity’.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” I replied, “the mule is not the
happiest and most placid animal in the world.
The clam is his superior in many respects.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there are many human clams.
I fancy, however, that you do not envy them,
doctor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not so sure about that, my
dear young friend. The higher emotions and
more refined sensibilities are the foundation
of most of the sorrows of life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
“But what of the pleasures, doctor?”</p>

<p>“True, I had forgotten them,” I replied.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>We sat for some time, young Smith and I,
silently gazing into the fireplace. My cigar
having gone out, I relighted it and began puffing
vigorously, with the result of blowing some
dense clouds of smoke in the direction of my
visitor. A sharp cough, followed by a decided
sputter, reminded me of my unintentional
discourtesy.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, my boy, but I forgot that you
are not used to tobacco.”</p>

<p>The wise child smiled, and with a humorous
twinkle in his bright eyes replied:</p>

<p>“Well, doctor, you haven’t given me much
opportunity to become inured to it this evening—save
by proxy, and there are some things
that cannot be done by proxy with any degree
of satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, boy! You don’t mean to
say that you smoke?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I, though? Just try me and see.”</p>

<p>Amazed though I was, I politely extended
my cigar case. With the air of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">connoisseur</i>,
my visitor selected one, bit off the end, and,
taking my proffered match, lighted the weed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
and began smoking, with all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang froid</i>
of an old timer.</p>

<p>“By Jove! doctor, you don’t smoke drugstore
cigars, I see.”</p>

<p>“N—no,” I said, “I get the best there is
in the market,” meanwhile mentally apologizing
to my friend K——, the pharmacist who
had given me the box from which that very
cigar was taken.</p>

<p>“Do you know, doctor, I haven’t enjoyed
a smoke for ages. I used to ‘hit the pipe,’
as you now express it, when I was on earth
before. But then,” he sighed, “opium was
opium in those days.”</p>

<p>“And pray, what is it nowadays?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Soothing syrup, b’gosh! And I don’t like
it a little bit, though I’ve swallowed a barrel
of it.</p>

<p>“Which reminds me that you doctors don’t
know much about colicky babies,” said my
visitor.</p>

<p>“N—no—I don’t suppose we do know a
great deal about infantile colic—save by its
works—drat it!”</p>

<p>“And its music,” said young Smith, chuckling
audibly, as a prolonged, painful, quavering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
wail was wafted in at the window from a
house across the street.</p>

<p>“Come, come, my boy, you mustn’t be too
hard on us doctors. Besides, that confounded
young one over yonder isn’t under my care.
If he was it might be different. One of my
brethren from Dearborn Avenue has charge
of him. He doesn’t seem to be succeeding
very well, either, for the little fiend is yelling
night and day. He has kept me awake nights
for about three weeks. If I shut down the
windows, I smother, and if I open them that
vicious little animal disturbs my rest—and
there you are!”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you do something for the
poor little chap?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as I told you, he’s not my patient.
It wouldn’t be ethical for me to chip in,” I
replied. “And besides, I don’t think his mother
would give him the medicine, even if I should
send it over.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you think you could relieve him,
eh? I am glad to know there is one doctor who
knows how to treat colic. Really, I’m almost
sorry I haven’t had it since I have been under
your care. Tell me, pray, what would you give
the child?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
“Four ounces of chloroform,” I replied, vindictively.</p>

<p>“The trouble with you doctors nowadays,”
said the Smith baby, “is that you talk too much
about microbes. Do you remember that attack
of cholera-infantum I had?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I should rather think I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, you talked about toxins, and microbes,
until you made me sicker than ever. There I
was, drinking hog-wash baby-food out of a
dirty old bottle through a nasty rubber tube,
and poisoning myself every time I did it, and you
talking about germs and such things! Germs
be blowed! I was suffering from an overdose of
dirt—just plain ordinary dirt. Mother was too
busy with her receptions and parties, to attend
to me, and that fool nurse neglected me. You
told her to scald my bottle, but she never did it.
Why, the day before I fell sick, the cat was playing
with that infernal tube for a straight two
hours.”</p>

<p>My visitor was becoming excited. He fairly
shrieked—“Microbes, germs, toxins! Dirt, sir,
just plain, common, everyday dirt!”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “some of us doctors are beginning
to believe that while there may be a distinction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
between dirt and microbes, there’s precious
little practical difference after all.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the Lord ever intended man to
smoke,” said the wise child. “He would have
made the tobacco plant the tree of knowledge,
if he had known as much about nicotine as we
do.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” I replied, “but there are different
opinions on that subject. A radical old minister
once said that if the Lord had intended man
to smoke, he would have put a chimney in the
back of his head.”</p>

<p>“Humph! that old fool didn’t know much. If
he had ever smoked—a—cigar like this—he—would—”</p>

<p>My young friend paused, and put his hand to
the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear boy, you seem distressed.
Really, you are quite pale. Pray, let me get
you some—”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing, doctor, I—well, you see, I
am not used to—to late hours,” said the poor
little chap, with a painful effort to smile.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some fresh air might make you feel
better,” I suggested, “I will raise another
window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
“N—no, never mind. I believe I’ll just step
to the door for a moment, if you don’t object. I
feel a little—”</p>

<p>I grasped the situation, and hastily escorted
my visitor to the veranda.</p>

<p>Appreciating the delicacy of my guest’s position,
I then discreetly returned to my sanctum
and resumed my cigar. Certain peculiar sounds
that came through the open door, confirmed my
hasty diagnosis.</p>

<p>I waited until the tumultuous heavings of my
young friend’s diaphragm had ceased, and then
went out to ask him to return to the library, but
he was nowhere to be seen. The “wise child”
had gone!</p>

<p>As I stood there musing, and thinking that
nicotine levels all intellectual distinctions between
children, a firm hand was laid on my
shoulder and a voice said in my ear:</p>

<p>“Doctor, you have been sleeping in your chair
about long enough. Go to bed, you silly fellow!”</p>

<p>I was about to follow my wife’s advice, <span class="locked">when—</span></p>

<p>“Ting-aling-a-ling!” came a ring at the
telephone.</p>

<p>“Hello, hello! What’s wanted?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
“Why, the baby’s got the colic to beat the very
devil, and I wish you’d come down right away.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” I howled. “You’ll have to get
some other doctor. I don’t call on strangers at
night,” adding, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto voce</i>, “nor anybody else,
if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Why, doctor, don’t you know who this is?”</p>

<h2 id="LEAVES_FROM_A_SUICIDES">LEAVES FROM A SUICIDE’S DIARY</h2>
</div>

<p>I was very young when the idea of suicide
first suggested itself to me;—my life had its
troubles as far back as my memory extends.
I have a vivid recollection of taking a certain
degree of interest in the subject when I was a
mere lad,—long before I first thought of keeping
a record of my impressions. My father had
whipped me for some trivial matter; so trivial
was it, and so severe my punishment, that I
was overwhelmed with a sense of the cruel injustice
of it all. Father was a stern, cold man,
and a man of moods. He could be affectionate
at times, and I presume that deep down in his
heart he loved me, but, as I have said, he was
a man of moods—and they were not always
pleasant ones for those around him. It is a
curious psychic fact that some men are subject
to storms of passion which, concealed through
politic motives from all but those most entitled
to consideration, seemingly must be vented
upon those whom affection should protect.
My father was such a man, and I, his eldest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
child, was the member of the family who most
often suffered from his horrible nerve storms.
As I grew older he became more and more
inconsiderate in his treatment of me, and more
and more severe in his punishments.</p>

<p>I believe that all boys of good breeding and
average physical stamina, are conscious at
times that paternal punishment is frequently
dictated by love and sincere interest in the
welfare of the victim. It is this sort of punishment
that is followed by a healthy moral and
physical reaction. But with punishment undeserved,
and out of all proportion to the offense
which it is intended to reprove, it is quite different.
Once let a boy experience such punishment,
and there arises in him a sense of rebellion
against parental authority, and his respect and
affection for the parent becomes tinctured
with bitterness that even Time cannot efface.</p>

<p>Once let the iron of vindictive resentment
against oppression and injustice enter his soul,
and your loving and lovable boy becomes
transformed—he ages perceptibly, and his fair
young life, his innocent childhood is gone—to
return no more. “When I am a man!” he cries,
and that part of the river of life which flows
between childhood and manhood,—his youth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>—is
spanned by a bridge of sighs over which he
who crosses can not return. “WHEN I AM
A MAN!” Alas! the bitter words are hardly
spoken ere the boy is a man—and such a man!
A man without memory of happy and tranquil
youth—is he not a flower that has bloomed to
a semblance of maturity, yet has never been
pervaded by that subtle fragrance which only
the warm, tender affection of budding youth
imparts?</p>

<p>In my case the effect was very peculiar;
I was made to feel not only the injustice of my
punishment, but a profound sense of humiliation.
My pride was wounded more than my
physical body—and, God knows, that was
wounded severely enough. Ah, thou hadst a
heavy hand, oh father mine! Would that I had
experienced more of resentment and less of
mortification. The former would have been
bad enough, but the latter made life a hell on
earth for me. I was fragile, nervous, sensitive,
and of a physique that ill bore abuse. Sensitive
though my physical body was, I had a mental
make-up that was even more so. How I
brooded over that terrible whipping—the last
my father ever gave me, for he died soon after.
The world seemed so dark and gloomy to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
There was no rift in those sombre clouds that
gave forth the bitter rain which tinctured my
young life with gall and wormwood. There
was no happiness anywhere.</p>

<p>My mother, angel that she was, and is,—if
there be aught of justice or compassion in the
hereafter,—tried to stem the torrent of grief
that was overwhelming my young life, tried
to dispel the poisonous miasm that had disseminated
itself throughout every element of
my moral and intellectual being, by such love
and consolation as only a tender, sympathetic
mother can give, but in vain. A constant,
oppressive, deeply rooted melancholy took possession
of me. I lost my animation and became
as near a misanthrope as one of my years and
limited experience could possibly be. And
the shadow of that storm cloud of emotion
has never been quite dissipated in the wearing
of the passing years of life’s battle. Woe to
him the memory of whose youth is enwrapped
in a funereal pall and in whose mouth there
remains the bitter taste of humiliation, of
outraged pride and self-respect.</p>

<p>It was during the period immediately following
the castigation I have mentioned, that the
notion of self-destruction first crystallized in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
my mind. I do not remember just how I
reasoned upon the matter; I recall clearly
enough, however, that I was profoundly impressed
with the idea that my woes were bearing
me down to the depths of misery and despair.
There rested upon me a dreadful incubus from
which there seemed to be but one means of
escape.</p>

<p>I had seen persons lying dead, and I remember
that in my despairing, hopeless state of mind the
thought of the peaceful, quiet expression upon
their faces was positively fascinating to me.
I found myself dwelling upon it with much
interest, and a feeling akin to envy.</p>

<p>Well, as I have said, I do not remember
precisely how I formulated my conclusions, but
I finally resolved to make away with myself.
Unfortunately, however, one of the traits with
which I was endowed by nature, was a fear of
physical suffering, and when the resolution to
take my own life had been formed, I still had
to deal with my physical cowardice.</p>

<p>It has been said that only cowards and lunatics
commit suicide. There was never a greater
lie than this. Lunatics may suicide—cowards,
never. It requires true heroism to face an
unknown hereafter—to fly from those ills we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
have to those we know not of. And the hapless
one to whom life is a burden must have courage
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>, to enable him to face that dread
future which, if he be scripturally credulous,
must needs be more fearful than the terrestrial
unhappiness that he fain would escape. No,
suicide requires bravery, and I was not brave—I
had hardly gotten beyond that dread of darkness
and solitude which is the bane of childish existence.
What wonder that I dreaded to take
so radical a road out of my slough of despond?</p>

<p>The physical penalty of self-destruction was
the most important obstacle to be overcome if
I would escape from my mental slavery. So
great was my dread of it, that—well, I lived,
and, more’s the pity, am still living, a miserable
misanthrope, in whom the misery of the present
is exceeded only by his dread of the unknown
country, and his physical fears of the means
necessary to take him hence.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I wonder if there are many who are entrusted
with the care of youth, who ever think of their
influence in moulding its future destinies. I
have long since forgiven my father for his harshness—but
the memory of my youthful sorrows
can never be effaced. Does science recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
such a thing as a mental scar? It should.
And mental scars, though unseen, are not only
permanent, but ever painful. Death finally
claimed my father through his one infirmity.
He died of apoplexy, superinduced by one of
his attacks of blind, unreasoning passion. I
know not where he is, but I trust he is unconscious
of the results of his mismanagement of
his unfortunate son. I say I know not where
he is, advisedly. My views of the hereafter—if
I may call the chaotic ideas I have hitherto
entertained, views—have undergone considerable
modification of late. I am losing my
egotism, and gradually coming to believe that
death is but another name for oblivion. How
prosaic it is, to be sure. By no means so
satisfying to the ignorant, and those of the
faith—which is sometimes another way of
putting the same proposition—as that halo of
glory for the good, or that blaze of everlasting
fire for the wicked, which theology from time
immemorial has prescribed for the dying. And
if oblivion be the finality, what more could the
All Father do for his tired children?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>What would my life have been had I possessed
a different temperament? Possibly if I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
been born of other blood, and under more
propitious skies, I would have seen the world
through different eyes. There might have been
more <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coleur de rose</i> and less of sombre tints and
neutrals. To be born in the shadows—ah, me!
The sun of morning has never gilded my mountain
tops, nor even at mid-day penetrated the
fog and gloom of the valleys of my soul. Golden
sunsets and glorious afterglows are not for me.
Twilight alone is, and ever has been mine.
Perhaps if I could have loved—’Tis said that love
illumines one’s soul. But I have never loved.
There was once a woman, whom men called
beautiful, but I do not remember much of her.
She had a skin of blood and milk, golden hair,
and pale blue eyes that never looked straight
at you. Her voice, as I recall it, was sweet
enough, but it did not ring true, and when she
laughed—but why do I speak of her? She did
not understand, and she is but a dream figure
now.</p>

<p>Some one has said that ambition is the main-spring
of life. I do not know, yet I have had
ambition—of a certain kind. Mine has been to
learn, to know, to acquire wisdom that should
raise me out of the dead level of mediocrity.
But Ambition is the twin sister of Discontent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
and Discontent is the mother of Melancholy
and Despair. Work as I might—and I have
never been a drone—there has always been some
one just ahead of me whose results were so
much more commendable than my own that,—well,
one might as well work on, even though
he never accomplishes anything worth while.
Certain it is that the world has been no better
for anything I ever did. And still I work. I
often wonder if the fellow ahead of me in life’s
battle does not feel the same way;—there’s
always another just ahead of him. There can
be no satisfaction in work well done when
another goal is looming up just beyond the one
we have reached. I saw a herd of cattle the
other day, lying beneath a spreading oak,
placidly chewing their cuds, and as I looked at
them I fancied they gazed at me somewhat pityingly.
“Ah,” I thought, “here is contentment
indeed.” I really envied them—until I noticed
the flies that tormented their glossy hides. One
might as well be tormented by ambitions as by
flies and gnats. Possibly Nature is jealous of
her children, and will permit none of them to
experience the joy of mere living unannoyed.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A friend of mine once said to me, “How very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
odd, that you should have taken up the science
of chemistry and made a recluse of yourself,
delving and diving into secrets of nature which,
as you have never made any practical use of
them, might as well have remained mysteries.”
Here was another who did not understand—another
who, like all the rest of those who
called themselves and whom I called my friends,
could not sympathize with me in my devotion
to study, because there were no flesh pots in
sight to serve as a motive for the work. To
such sordid ones I could not well lay bare the
bitter humiliations with which my all too
evident failure to attain practical results have
afflicted me. I could not lay bare the secret
aspirations that impelled me to seek for things
which would have given me a place as a benefactor
of my kind and enrolled me among the
immortals. And suppose I had ever confessed
that the mystery of ancient alchemy so impressed
me that I must needs grasp at its only
modern representative, chemistry—would not
my friends have laughed at me?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>What an atmosphere the chemical laboratory
is for one of my temperament! What a fascination
there is in the thought that the door of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
escape for the world weary,—which, as dear
old Epictetus said, is always open,—is so near—so
near that one must needs be careful lest
he pass the portals ere he is ready. How many
times have I wondered if what the text books
say of arseniureted hydrogen, and of anhydrous
hydrocyanic acid is really true. And how
many times have I been tempted to—well, to
put them to a test on a fellow worker. Not upon
myself, for I am not yet ready, and I do not
court death by accident. My own death must
be philosophic when it comes, not sudden and
devoid of impressions. Then, too, the slower
things are more to my taste—morphine for
example. When I am ready—when life becomes
insupportable boredom, or an intolerable
ache, I shall know just where and how to seek
surcease of world tire. And what a record I
will write of my impressions. How deliberate
and scientific it will all be. And how sure I
will make it. These amateurs, with their
crude methods and cowardly shrinkings back
from the brink—faugh! how I detest them.
The idiots! what a mess some of them make of
it, and how some of them suffer. As for the
fools who do such bungling work that any cheap
doctor called in a hurry can undo the thing—no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
words of mine can express my contempt for
them. That doctor who swallowed six grains
of morphine and then when the mist began to
rise, sent for another fool of his own profession
to succor him, was a coward and a bungler.
But, I have said that a suicide is never a
coward. Yes, and I meant it, too; that doctor
was a pretender, and not born in the purple.</p>

<p>These love lorn servant girls and heart sick
youths who drink to Death libations of carbolic
acid are most amusing folk. They have courage,
it is true, and doubtless mean well, but
they lack the brains to be original and clever.
They are faddists gone mad.</p>

<p>I have studied all of the methods of suicide
in vogue and the more I see of them, the wiser
I think I was in selecting chemistry as my life
work. I have haunted the morgue; I have
followed to that horrid, dripping, smelly slab,
every case of suicide that has happened in this
city. And such sights as I have seen! Bloated,
festering masses of flesh that required great
imagination to fashion into human semblance,
fresh dragged from summer waters; distorted,
blackened faces on agony twisted forms freshly
cut down from self-made gibbets; heads blown
open, brain-bespattered and powder-marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
by the pistol; limbs crushed and torn into
disgusting masses and shreds of ghastly flesh,
the bones staring through in besplintered protest
against the savagery of men who seek rest
beneath the crunching wheels of locomotives;
sickening, fresh made gashes in throats that
were once fair to look upon—all these have I
seen and marveled at.</p>

<p>Only yesterday I saw lying upon that familiar
slab, an old, old man—found dead in bed
with his throat cut from ear to ear, a letter in
his hand saying only this: “I am tired, so tired.”
“What a pity it is,” I thought, as I looked at
the fearful gash through which swollen tongue
and severed larynx protruded, at the blood
bathed clod which perchance had once been
loved, “that this man should have lived so
long without learning a way.”</p>

<p>Then there was that dead man I saw taken
from the river the other day. His friends
knew of his business troubles and feared he
had suicided. They sought for him for days
and days, poor fools. They found him at last,
and he went the way of all the others—to that
vile slab. I was there when his sweetheart
came to see his remains. They tried to keep
her out, but she entered the room in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
them. I was not surprised at what happened.
The transition from her ideal, the lover of her
memory, to that slimy, oozy, bloated thing
with the maggots swarming from its nose and
eyes and ears, was enough to shock a stronger
heart than hers. She died in a mad house,
screaming against the maggots that she fancied
were devouring her.</p>

<p>Ah, there’s much of comfort in the thought
that one has learned a way, and that my work
in science has not all come to naught. How
I admire that man of whom my friend Dr.
X. told me this morning, who laughed at the
doctors who worked a whole night over him,
trying to save him from self poisoning. He
would revive for a moment under their efforts
and mutter, “No you don’t, d—n you,—you
can’t do it!” and then lapse into coma again.
He knew a way, did that man. The stupid
doctors did not know. He, like myself, was a
chemist. Was he merely defiant, or was it
professional pride that animated him when he
challenged those fool doctors, who came to
interfere with his plans, but knew nothing of
the symptoms produced by a clever admixture
of laudanum and potassium cyanide? I glory
in that noble man’s artistic achievement—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
glory in his vindication of individual rights.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Existence is growing absolutely insupportable
to me. My synthetic experiments with
organic elements which seemed so promising
have come to naught. Another of my failures!
I haven’t the energy to begin all over again,
neither am I disposed to devise experiments
in other fields. My brain is pumped out, like
a dry well. My heart is dead. I suppose one
might live with a dead heart, but what’s the
use? I begin to believe that it is time to—well,
to follow the <em>way</em>. There, in that bottle upon
the shelf, are four grains of—I wonder if my
figuring was correct? There’s surely enough.
But suppose there should be too much? Pshaw!
Why do I doubt? My experimental provings
have been too carefully made to admit of suspicion
of inaccuracy. That huge dog <span class="locked">which—</span></p>

<p>Why not to-night? “If ’twere done, when
’tis done, ’twere well it were done quickly.”
There is no reason why I should not. My
affairs—What affairs? I have no affairs. My
family? There is none. My friends? Possibly
there are some who will read the obituary
in to-morrow’s paper, and sorrow over the
necessity of going to the “crank professor’s”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
funeral. They will have no keener regret, for,
thank the fates, there will be no funeral expenses,
and no contributions will be levied;
I have attended to all that. My friend, Dr. X.,
is a prosector at the university, and to him
my body is willed. He has promised to wire
the skeleton for the museum. Good fellow, X.
No sentimental gush about him. I wonder
how the skeleton will look. I hope X. knows
the French method of cleaning bones. It
would be some satisfaction to know that mine
will be white and glistening, and nice to handle.
I wonder what those French fellows use that
gives that faint sweet smell to newly bleached
human bones. I suppose I might have written
and found out, but I never thought of that.</p>

<p>As usual at this hour I am alone in the
laboratory. It is barely possible that Professor
A. may return to-night. I fancy he did not
quite finish that experiment to-day. It would
be embarrassing if he should come in before
I had passed clear through the door. With
that narcotic there would be great danger of
such a mishap. I want to acquit myself at
least as creditably as did that man of whom my
friend Dr. X.—Great Charon! the very thing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
There should be a bottle of cyanide somewhere
upon the <span class="locked">shelves—</span></p>

<p>How very awkward! Who could have misplaced
that bottle? I thought I knew just
where to put my hand upon it. Well, there’s
no use fretting about it, to-morrow I will—Ah,
now I think of it, there’s a vial of anhydrous
prussic acid in that little drawer in A.’s desk,
and I have a key!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I fancy I can do the work much more artistically
than did X.’s patient. I will take the
narcotic in its most elegant and concentrated
form, instead of that beastly tincture. I hate
nauseous medicines. As for the prussic acid,
I will use a hypodermic. Fortunately there is
one yonder, in the room for animal experimentation.
I will take the morphia first, and
when it begins to act, I will get the syringe.
There will be plenty of time.</p>

<p>How simple; just a tongue coating of powder—a
mere fleeting dash of bitter—a draught of
water and—so far the narcotic. Now, to await
results.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>How exhilarating the primary effects of
opium. How easy to chronicle one’s impressions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
How I can write! No wonder that
De Quincey—; I seem to be in a brighter sphere.
It is as though the air of the laboratory had
turned to pure oxygen. What strength I feel!
What mighty deeds could I not accomplish now?
How large and vivid the gas lights are. There
is an aureola of secondary glow about each of
them. I would experiment with them to-morrow
if— What music is that? Is it not
beautiful? Why, I know that air—it is one my
mother used to sing when I was a little lad—I
remember how my dear little sister used to—But
how faint the strains are now. And the
lights are growing dim. It will soon be dark.
My chair is rocking, too. How soothing and
sensuous the motion seems. How drowsy I am
getting—I must take that hypodermic before
I get too sleepy.</p>

<p>There, that shows what will power can do.
Some men would have gone to sleep and forgotten
the rest of their plans. How orderly
and systematic A. is, to be sure. No rummaging
around in the drawer amid a confusion of things
to find the prussic. How tight the stopper is.
There, now I have it. Pshaw! I’ve spilled
half of it on the floor and cut my fingers. How
clumsy and numb my fingers are, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
hot and fiery this blood is. How delightful
the prussic smells.</p>

<p>Just a drop—the morphia will combine with
it and neutralize it. The drugs will neutralize
each other just sufficiently to give me plenty
of time, and I shall still be able to write. Here,
in my thigh—just here— Ah! My God! too

<h2 id="CHIQUITA">CHIQUITA</h2>
</div>

<p>I had been rambling about through Calaveras,
investigating mining properties, and incidentally
enjoying to the full the glorious weather of the
early California spring. My search for the pot
of gold at the foot of the rainbow had led me
far up among the majestic Sierras—those
wondrous mountains at the foot of which was
verdure more beautiful than any artist could
portray, while their snow-covered tops reared
themselves proudly through the clouds and,
peering beyond, seemed to challenge the very
sky to descend and meet them. The ravines
and gulches were tortured and torn by rushing
torrents from the melting snows above. Every
rivulet had become a brook, every brook a
river, and every river a veritable Niagara.</p>

<p>So replete with the swift rushing yellow waters
were the courses of the mountains and valleys,
that the venerable wise-acre, yclept “the oldest
inhabitant,” was permitted by his neighbors
to croak to his heart’s content, and actually
held his audiences while he regaled them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
the horrors of “the freshet of the spring of ’61
and ’62,” and chilled the very marrow of their
bones with the ominous prophecy that the
present gorging of the streams was but the
forerunner of a rising of the waters which
should make the famous old-time flood of the
Sacramento Valley fade into nothingness.</p>

<p>I had been leisurely retracing my steps from
the mountains, and returning by the “Big Tree”
road through the historic town of Murphy’s
Camp—made famous by Bret Harte, and
interesting to me because I had there spent
several of the years of my childhood—arrived
at the little town of Vallecito, where I intended
to inspect some placer property.</p>

<p>The ardent, coppery-red ball of the California
sun was just descending behind the foothills
to westward when I arrived at my destination,
hence there was nothing to do save to
make myself as comfortable as possible at the
little ramshackle inn, “The Miner’s Rest,”
and defer all thought of business until the
morrow.</p>

<p>Life in the foothills of the Sierras may be
monotonous, but it has its pleasant features,
not the least of which was the fare of the humble
Miner’s Rest. I found that Mr. Jim Truesdell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
the landlord, had not boasted when he said
genially, “We ain’t much on style hereabouts,
Mister, but you kin bet your bottom dollar our
feed is just as good, an’ just as plenty as it is at
the Frisco Palace; tho’ we ain’t braggin’ none
about variety on our meenu kyards.”</p>

<p>Having finished my supper, I lighted a cigar
and strolled out upon the rude, tumble-down
veranda of the little inn. Seating myself with
my feet planted upon the railing and a book
upon my lap, I proceeded to enjoy my smoke.
Then—my book forgotten—I fell into the revery
which the fragrant smoke wreaths of a good
cigar and the glorious flame of a dying sun bring
to him who is at peace with himself and his
surroundings.</p>

<p>More beautiful sunsets there may be than
those of my native heath, but I have never
seen but one that could in any way compare
with them, and even there, in a harbor of far-off
Guatemala, the conditions, save for the brilliant
ocean rim below which the sun sank to sleep,
were much the same. The mountains to the
eastward of Vallecito recalled the Sierra Madre,
of that distant alien land. There were the same
fleecy clouds, illumined by the waning fire of
the God of Day, reflecting colors that surely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
would have been the despair of the most ambitious
brush, and floating with soft caress over
the snow-capped peaks which, like grim and
watchful sentinels, walled in the valley where
nestled the little town. There was just breeze
enough blowing to give a keen zest to the
balm-laden air of the mountains—a feature
which that ever to be remembered scene in
the Bay of Ocos distinctly lacked, for ’twas a
miniature hell down there, night or day.</p>

<p>Save for the weird cry of some mysterious
night bird, who ever and anon called his mate,
and the infrequent whir of a diminutive species
of bat, everything was as quiet as a blue Sunday
in staid old New England. The “chug” of the
pick, the clamorous ring of the shovel and the
rattling of the miner’s cradle were conspicuously
absent in the valley and the hills and ravines
round about. So still was the little mining
town, that a giant elk who was sniffing the air
in a spirit of curious and careful investigation
far up the mountain side, came nearer and yet
nearer, tossing his head with its burden of enormous
horns in defiance at first, and then standing
stock-still as if amazed. When he had finished
his tour of investigation, he turned and
stalked majestically away down the side of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
rocky gorge that would scarcely have afforded
safe footing for a cat. He glanced back several
times as though he did not quite understand his
undisputed kingship, and then, with a farewell
belligerent toss of his mighty antlers, plunged
into the obscurity of the beautiful manzanita,
and scraggly <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">mésquite</i> and chapparal that
fringed the steep canyon sides of the awesome
Sierras.</p>

<p>As the elk disappeared, a long, sobbing, terrifying
wail was wafted from amid the scrub
firs and tall bread pines still higher up on a distant
mountain side. It was the cougar’s warning
to his tawny mate. The elk was not king,
nor yet was the hungry panther, for somewhere
amid those far-off mountain ravines was the
lair of the grizzly, fiercest of his kind.</p>

<p>The last red glow of the setting sun had faded
from the western sky and the chill of night was
fast gathering, yet I still sat there upon the veranda,
half asleep, but breathing in deeply the
invigorating fragrant balm that was borne to
me by the cool evening breeze from the spicy
mountain firs and pines and giant redwoods.
As I dozed my cigar fell from my lips and bounded
off the veranda to the ground, where it lay
glowering reproachfully at me for a few moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
before it finally went out altogether,
smothering in its own ashes and spitefully emitting,
as a farewell indignant protest, the acrid
odor of dead tobacco.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Buenos tardes, Señor Caballero.</i>”</p>

<p>I came to myself with a start, and turned in
the direction of the voice.</p>

<p>At the foot of the two or three steps that led
to the veranda where I was sitting, stood a man
and a woman—evidently Mexicans—as queer a
couple as it had ever been my fortune to meet.
The man was apparently about sixty years of
age, taller than most of his race, still stalwart
and erect and, despite his years, a handsome
fellow of his type. He carried his head as
haughtily as might an hidalgo of Old Spain.
His picturesque costume was bedecked with
finery which, faded though it was, indicated
the garb of a Mexican of the higher caste. His
swarthy face was shaded by an ornate sombrero,
from beneath which flashed piercing, fiery eyes
that would have compelled attention anywhere.
A broad silk sash encircled his waist, and artistically
draped over his shoulder were the graceful
folds of a bright, many-colored <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">serape</i>.
Through the sash was thrust the inevitable
murderous-looking <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">cuchillo</i>—the symbol of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
individuality and a declaration of that belief
in personal responsibility which is as inseparable
from the hot Latin blood as though it were
dependent upon a special corpuscle.</p>

<p>Unlike her companion, the woman presented
a figure that was pathetic, rather than picturesque,
although she too showed in her apparel
something of the fondness for color and tinsel
that characterizes her race. She appeared to
be old—much older than her companion, although
appearances are very deceptive in judging
the age of women of the Latin races. They
mature young, and their youth and beauty
begin to fade very early, so early that at a period
when the woman of fair Anglo-Saxon blood
is yet in her prime, her darker-skinned sister
is already old and wrinkled.</p>

<p>The old crone—for so she appeared—was bent
and withered, with hair as white as human hair
ever becomes. Her face was fearfully disfigured
by smallpox, that loathsome disease which had
become a curse to her people. As she raised her
eyes towards me, I noted with something of a
shock that she was totally blind—the dull and
expressionless eyes showed that only too plainly.
Used as I was to the sight of human misery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
helplessness, there was something in the poor
old woman’s face that impressed me.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Buenos tardes, Señor Caballero</i>,” again said
the man, with a polite bow. “<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Comprende
V. Espanol?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Muy poco</i>—very little—<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then will I speak the tongue of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Americanos</i>,
though I speak it not well,” he continued.
“I hope <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Señor</i> he is not disturb in his smoke
of the evening by the speaking to him.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Sir,” I answered politely.</p>

<p>“Then, maybe, it is not too free to ask <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el
Señor</i> if he will have the fortune told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a fortune teller, eh?”</p>

<p>The Mexican raised his head proudly.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Non, Señor</i>, it is not I that have fortunes to
tell. Ramon Pasquale never has told yet the
fortune. He does not know. It is my Chiquita
here, she the great fortunes can tell. She can
see, oh, so far! She sees not as <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Señor</i> sees,
with the eyes of the head;—it is with the eyes
of the mind, with the eyes of the soul that
Chiquita sees. She knows how the past to tell.
Aye, and the future too, she knows. She the
stars can read—she reads them true. The
grave to her is not closed. Fate is to the eyes of
her mind as is to <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Señor’s</i> eyes the open book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
upon his knee. She is wonderful, my Chiquita!
Is it not so, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">cara mia</i>?” There was a tender
note in his voice as he addressed his aged companion.</p>

<p>“It is so, my Ramon,” replied the woman, in
a voice that fairly startled me, so clear and
youthful did it seem. “It is so, and if the great
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i> will allow me it to tell, I will to him read
the story of the past of his life, and for him open
the book of the future, that he may know what
shall come to him.”</p>

<p>My expression must have betrayed the interest
I felt, for the Mexican said eagerly: “To-night
must <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Señor</i> listen to Chiquita. To-morrow
she will be gone, and it too late will be. It is
not dear, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, it is <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">muy barato</i>—very cheap;
only one <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">peso</i>; that is all. And so wonderful,
so wonderful, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>! There is none so wonderful
as Chiquita. <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">El Señor</i> he will never forget
the fortune she for him will tell—and only one
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">peso</i>.”</p>

<p>And Chiquita told my fortune, and evidently
tried to give me good measure, for the stars were
out and the moon was silvering the eastern sky
ere she had finished.</p>

<p>Granting that Ramon was sincere, and not
merely attending to business in his enthusiastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
praises of Chiquita’s professional skill, he and I
differed somewhat in our estimate of it. There
was nothing very new about the fortune the old
woman mapped out for me. It had the same
rose color as many others I had heard. There
were the usual platitudes about the honors I
was to win, and the riches I was to gain. I
would become famous, also, and was destined
to marry a woman for whom my own country
surely could hold no place, for, according to the
fortune teller’s description, she was to be a
duchess, no less. Of course, as I did not tell
Chiquita that I was already married, I could
find no fault with the bride to be, especially as
she was of the blood royal.</p>

<p>But Chiquita was eloquent, in her broken
way, and both she and her picturesque companion
were so interesting that I did not begrudge
the dollar which, after all, she had fairly earned.
To hear pleasant things about one’s self is
always worth the price—and there always is a
price, although we are not often wise enough to
know it.</p>

<p>There was that in the poise of Chiquita’s
white head and the sweetly modulated tones of
her voice which, with her small, slender, beautifully
formed brown hands suggested that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
birth and breeding were more aristocratic than
is usual with itinerant vendors of fortunes.</p>

<p>I was curious to know more of the interesting
couple, but had been riding hard that day, and
the prospect of a good bed was just then more
attractive than character study with a pair of
strolling Mexicans for subjects. The séance of
fortune telling ended, I was glad to pay for my
entertainment and say good-night to them.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Gracias, Señor—buenos noches.</i> We are much
thankful, my Chiquita and I. Is it not so, my
Chiquita?”</p>

<p>The old woman bowed gracefully, and echoed
her companion’s expression of appreciation and
farewell greeting. As I turned to enter the inn
the landlord met me at the door, saying:</p>

<p>“Your room’s all ready, Mister. It’s been
ready for more’n an hour. I seen you was havin’
your fortune told, an’ as the old gal allus dishes
up as good ones for the money as can be had in
these diggin’s, I thought I wouldn’t disturb ye.
I hope ye got all the trimmin’s that was comin’
to ye,” and he grinned expansively.</p>

<p>“I have no fault to find with the fortune the
old woman told me,” I replied smilingly; “it
was doubtless better than I deserve, and I suspect
much better than I will ever experience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
I was far more interested in Chiquita and
Ramon, her companion, than in her skill as a
fortune teller. I am curious to learn something
of them. Do you know anything about
them?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, leastwise not enough to hurt. The
old gal is some sort of a gypsy, I reckon. She
sure is, if there’s any Mexican gypsies. The
feller with her is a Greaser all right, though I’ll
allow I don’t know nothin’ else agin him. They
blew in on this town about ten years ago, an’
have been comin’ here off an’ on, workin’ the
fortune tellin’ racket ever since.”</p>

<p>“Well, they are not likely to get rich at it,” I
said. “Vallecito does not seem to be a very profitable
field for their particular specialty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” replied the
genial Jim. “Of course, this town ain’t what
she was in the early days,” and the old “forty-niner”
sighed retrospectively. “But it ain’t so
bad, after all. It’s a little out o’ season now,
but when strangers come through here on the
way to Mariposa and Calaveras, I reckon it’s
pretty good pickin’ for the old woman and her
pal. The Big Trees and the Calaveras caves
draw pretty good crowds, and they’re the kind
of people that’s got mighty tender feet, too—an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
some money. I sort o’ like them kind, myself.”</p>

<p>“Is anything known of the history of those
Mexicans before they came to this part of the
country?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No; we folks don’t ask questions much, an’
Ramon, the Greaser, aint one of the talkative
kind. Anyhow, he don’t talk much to us. I
reckon though, that some o’ them tourists knows
how to make him loosen up. There was a feller
here once that writ stories for magazines an’
such, who told me that Ramon had spun him
some pretty wild yarns, an’ I believe he writ
some of ’em down in a book.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then a story has been published about
them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t reckon it was published none,”
replied mine host, facetiously. “That writer
feller tumbled off the foot-bridge into the Tuolumne
Canyon about a week after that, an’ I’m
afraid he didn’t go to press.</p>

<p>“But I’m runnin’ a hotel, such as it is, an’
hain’t got much time for fairy tales, an’ still
less time for Greasers, which the same I don’t
like nohow.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, my conversation with the
landlord had only served to increase my curiosity.
As I bade him good-night I resolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
to seek for Chiquita and Ramon in the morning.
I had scented a romance; which meant
with me that I must take the trail and run the
story to earth.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I found the fortune teller and her companion
in the cabin of a Mexican sheep herder, among
the hills a little way out of town. This is the
story that Ramon told me:</p>

<p>“Our story, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>? It is not much, our
story. What you have seen, that is all it is to
tell. It is the story of Chiquita, my Chiquita,
there, that you should hear. I, Ramon, know
the story. Alas! too well do I know it. Listen,
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>:</p>

<p>“Many, many years ago, in the days when
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">los Americanos</i>—the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">mineros</i>—were by hundreds
here in Calaveras and in the valley of Tuolumne,
a great <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i> there was, and a great mansion,
near Sonora, just by the road that now runs to
Vallecito. When the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i> rides to Sonora, at
the right hand of the road will he yet see the
stones of the crumbling walls of the house. He
cannot mistake, for all along the road is there
none other like it.</p>

<p>“Don Pedro Salvia, the name was, of the
owner of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>. Many broad acres of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
the hills and valleys were his, and over those
acres by the thousands grazed his cattle. All
the land it was black with his droves of the
long-horned breed of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">la España</i>. Horses too,
there were in vast herds. Never were seen
mustangs so many and so fine and swift as those
of Don Pedro. Many cattle and many mustangs
mean always much money, and Don Pedro was
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">muy rico</i>—of great riches.</p>

<p>“The old Don was proud, oh, so proud, but
not his great wealth was it that made him so.
Of a famous and haughty race he was. None
older was there in all Castile. His blood was
what the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Americano</i> would call—what is it
that they call the blood of the grandee? Ah,
I remember—he was of the blue blood. None
was there in all Spain so blue.</p>

<p>“In Sonora for many years had the Salvias
been—so long that no <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Americano</i> could remember
when the family was not there. Before
Don Pedro came, many, many generations of
the Salvias had lived and died on the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">rancheria</i>.</p>

<p>“Fate had laid its hand heavy on the blood
of the Salvias, for the Don was of his race the
last man. He had one child only—a daughter.
La Doña Teresa, her poor mother, had died
when she came—the little one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
“Chiquita was of Don Pedro’s life the sun.
He worshipped her even as worships the good
Catholic the Madonna. Never was maiden so
beautiful or so graceful. Ah! like the deer
was she graceful. And she was no plant of the
hot house. There was none among all the
herders who could throw the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">riata</i> as could
Chiquita. Of all the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">caballeros</i> of Sonora there
was not one who in riding could match her.
There was no mustang so wild that she could
not tame him. And shoot! Not in all California
was there a better shot with rifle or
pistol than Chiquita.</p>

<p>“And, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, she was not afraid—as any
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">caballero</i> she was brave. As free and fearless
as the young eagle she came and went among
the rough hill people. Once only, was any man
so bold as to give to Chiquita the insult. Ah!
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, beautiful to see it must have been!
Almost dead they found Léon Bodigo, the half
breed. All of his blood it had run out. The
maiden’s little <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">cuchillo</i>, it was sharp, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>.</p>

<p>“No companions had Chiquita, save the
birds and flowers, and the trees and brooks of
the mountains,—and Juan, her cousin. But
she was happy and had never the—what you
call it, eh? Ah, I have it, care. She had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
the care. She had never sorrow, and never had
tears wet her beautiful eyes since she was small—so
very small.</p>

<p>“Juan it was, who was of Chiquita the slave.
He was not so old as Chiquita. He was a lad
only—fourteen years of the age he was—but
there was no <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">caballero</i> more strong of heart
than he. Happy also, was Juan, for loved he
not Chiquita? Yes, with all his soul he loved
her. A thing wonderful to see was the love of
Juan for the beautiful Chiquita!</p>

<p>“When the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i> made of the cattle the
round up, with them rode Chiquita, and beside
her was Juan—always Juan. You should have
seen the riding, and of the herds the gathering,
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>. Nothing so grand is there now anywhere
to see.</p>

<p>“Many times when the throw was made for
the branding, and the fierce long-horn to the
ground was brought, it was with the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">riata</i> of
Chiquita. And, Juan, too, made his throw for
the iron. The count of Chiquita and Juan in
the throwing of the cattle the best <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaquero</i>
could not beat.</p>

<p>“But Paradise it is never to last. Dark days
there came to the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">rancheria</i> of the Salvias.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
It was over again the story of—Eden, yes?
In the beautiful garden the serpent?</p>

<p>“One day to the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">rancheria</i> came <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">un Inglés</i>, an
English Milord. A letter he bring from a
friend of Don Pedro’s, asking that he be made
welcome. That Englishman he was sick, very
sick, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>. Like a man who is starved he
looked. <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Dios!</i> he was white. He was so thin
that when the wind blew he trembled like a
leaf that on the tree is dead, and poof! poof!—how
he had the cough! He could not sit the
mustang, and the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i> they smile at him
when he ride. So weak he was that on the
ground he fall off—bang!</p>

<p>“But <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Medico</i> he have said that the Englishman
he must ride, ride, ride—or with the lungs
he will surely die. And so he try and try, for
he had the pluck, that Englishman. By and
by, he grow strong—strong like the bull. The
air of the hills is like the old wine of Oporto and
makes the great miracles. <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Carramba!</i>—the air
it did not know.</p>

<p>“When that Englishman he was strong to
ride steady, Juan was happy no more. Wherever
Chiquita was, there was Milord. He
learned to throw the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">riata</i> and with the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i>
to ride the herd. They ride not badly, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
cursed <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Inglés</i>. This fellow he ride bob! bob!
bob! up and down, always up and down—but
he ride straight like the soldier.</p>

<p>“How Juan hated that English Milord!
Little fool, that Juan! He did not know that
it was Juan that was too many in the riding of
pleasure. Ah! he was the great fool—he
thought it was the Englishman! For many
days he thought this foolish thought. So it
was, until one day Chiquita sent him away on a
mission that was useless. When he came back,
he saw her riding far away from the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>,
far away in the hills. The Englishman he was
beside her; so close to her he was that together
their knees were touching. And then Juan
knew! And then, so quick, like the lightning,
grew he from boy to man—and such a man!</p>

<p>“It runs hot, the blood of my people, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>,
and in the veins of none of his race had it ever
run hotter than it ran that day in the veins of
Juan. And bitter it ran, and everything it
was red to the eyes of Juan. One thing only
was there to do; the Englishman must die, and
Juan he must kill him!</p>

<p>“The next day again into the hills rode
Chiquita. Milord, the cursed Milord, was as
always beside her. Juan saw them at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
corral in the starting, and taking his rifle he
crawl, like <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">una serpiente</i>, on the belly through a
gulch between the hills that open on the road at
the turning. In the chapparal he crouched
and waited, like the panther that is hungry.
Nothing could save Milord, for when did Juan
ever miss the mark?</p>

<p>“But Chiquita made with the Englishman a
race, and so swift was her mustang that far
behind she left him. To the turn of the road
she came alone. Juan heard the beating of the
hoofs and thought it was time. He stood
straight up behind the brush of the greasewood
and manzanita, with his rifle at his shoulder—so!
Chiquita saw, and all at once she knew.</p>

<p>“So sudden it all was, and she ride so quick,
that Juan was close—oh, so close—to killing
Chiquita before he saw who was the rider.</p>

<p>“Straight at him the mustang she rode, and
then she stopped and looked into his eyes; oh,
so sad she looked. For a long time she looked
at him. He saw that she knew, and it was not
the eyes of Chiquita that fell—it was Juan’s.
And then she spoke:</p>

<p>“‘It is not for me, that my cousin he waits.
In his eyes is there murder, but it is not for his
Chiquita that he sees red. Is my cousin Juan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
a coward, that he lies in ambush? Does he
love me no longer? Is it that he would kill one
whom I love? Go, and go quickly, that he may
not see you—that he may not know that my
little Juan has put upon Chiquita and the house
of Salvia the great shame.’</p>

<p>“The Englishman he was not come to the bend
of the road before Juan was gone. And Juan
came not back to the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i> for the many,
many days. No one knew where he had gone,
but he was not far. He was near in the mountains;
like the cougar and the grizzly he was
hiding. Far from Chiquita he could not go.
Many the times she have passed him as he
crouched in the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">mésquite</i>, but she did not know.
Always was her Englishman to ride beside her.
Three, four, ten times could Juan have killed
him, but would not! Was it not that Chiquita
had said she have come to love the Milord?
And she have said, too, that it is coward to
shoot from the ambush. Juan loved Chiquita;
her heart he would not make to ache, and,
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, he was not coward, that little Juan!</p>

  <div class="caption">“IS MY COUSIN JUAN A COWARD, THAT HE LIES IN AMBUSH?”</div></div>

<p>“Every day, for many, many days, Juan,
from his hiding could see of the rides, the starting—Chiquita
and the Englishman—always the
cursed <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Inglés</i>! Not always would they ride near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Juan. One way sometimes, then next day another
way, but every day some way they ride—Chiquita
and her Englishman. And they ride
so close, so very close—so close together they
ride that Juan sometimes forgets almost, and
then he looks at the rifle. So hungry he looks
at it, and how the itching it is in the fingers! Always
is it loaded, the rifle, and it carries far and
true the bullet when Juan fires it. He is fine
shot, that little Juan.</p>

<p>“One day Chiquita and the Englishman they
not ride together. The Milord is alone. Next
day is he alone once more. He does not ride
the way of Juan. That is good, for Chiquita is
not there, and to remember is hard when she is
not there, and the gun it is loaded.</p>

<p>“Two days, then, the Englishman he ride alone.
The second day, in the evening, Juan sees the
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i> and the women run, and run—they run
about like jack-rabbits. And then they gather
together and talk, talk, always they talk; like
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el loro</i>, the parrot, they talk. There is no work.
For two days, Juan has not seen Don Pedro.</p>

<p>“The third day, in the morning, everything is
like dead at the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>. No one is stir, only
sometimes the dogs they bark. By and by
comes the Englishman out of the house, springs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
quick on his mustang and like the wind he is
off. He rides close by Juan, so near that the
boy he could have plucked him off his horse.
And the Englishman’s face it was white—white
just like a corpse. He ride like he is scared—like
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el diablo</i>—like the devil he ride!</p>

<p>“Juan, too, was scared. He was sure something
go bad, very bad, at the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>. And
so he is go down to the place and look all around,
but he is see nobody—they are all gone, the
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i> and the women.</p>

<p>“And then Juan go into the house. There he
find Don Pedro dying with <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">la viruela</i>, the smallpox,
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>! with nobody to care for him but
Chiquita, and one old woman that was call for
the joke, La Bonita, the beautiful, because she
have the pest long before and was, oh, so ugly!
Ah! the face of Don Pedro! It was horrible; it
made Juan to grow sick!</p>

<p>“But Juan stay and help the women. At
first the boy he was afraid, but he loved Chiquita,
and soon the pest he forgot.</p>

<p>“Well, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, soon and sure the end was. In
five days Don Pedro he was dead. And Juan
and La Bonita they bury him, with nobody to
help. Chiquita her heart is break. She cry
and cry and cry, but Juan he knew it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
all for that her father was dead. She would not
tell Juan, but he knew. The coward <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Inglés</i> that
have run away—for him also were the tears.</p>

<p>“A few days more and Chiquita too, was take
sick with the pest. This time it was not the
black smallpox—but it is bad, very bad. <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Jesu!</i>
How the old woman and the boy they make the
fight for Chiquita! And Chiquita she is not
die—she get well. Her face it is scar—so bad
is it scar that La Bonita herself is not less beautiful
than the poor Chiquita. And Juan he is
afraid—for some day she will know, so he take
away from the house all the bright things and
the mirrors and tell La Bonita the young <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señorita</i>
must not know. And the old woman she
understand, ah! too well she understand. She
remember the sorrow of the day she herself first
saw the scar of her face, and she is careful of
Chiquita.</p>

<p>“When Chiquita she could once more walk
about and breathe the sweet air of the pines,
everywhere with her went Juan. Once again
it was Juan—always Juan.</p>

<p>“When Chiquita she grew strong again, as
before the pest came, the poor boy he might
have been happy, but for one thing—tears,
tears, always tears in the eyes of Chiquita! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Juan he knew they were not all for Don Pedro.
Always in her mind that cursed Milord! Her
heart it still ache for the coward Englishman.</p>

<p>“Long walks Chiquita and Juan they take
together. She could again ride, but never did
she ask for her mustang. She for riding cared
no more. Always, you see, she is think of the
Englishman. And Juan, he know why she
wished not to ride, and his heart it was lead.</p>

<p>“But Juan was kind, so very kind to Chiquita.
Always he loved her, and the scar of the face
made to him no difference. But every day
does he fear the time when she must know.
That time, so much does he fear it, that the
brooks he would not let her cross; he was
afraid that in them her face she might see;
yet still did he know sure that sometime she
must see it.</p>

<p>“By and by the people is come back to the
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">rancheria</i>, and Juan he is do the best he can to
take care of the place, and the cattle and the
horses. For a little while things they go along
like before the pest it have kill Don Pedro.</p>

<p>“One day Juan he go into the hills for the
round up, and for two days he come not back.
Before he go he tell La Bonita to keep good
watch of the poor Chiquita, but all the same he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
afraid. All the time of the riding after the cattle
he is afraid it goes not well with Chiquita.</p>

<p>“When Juan he is get back from the round up,
the great trouble it have come. Chiquita she is
mad—she have gone crazy, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, and she does
not know anything—not anybody does she
know!</p>

<p>“From La Bonita Juan hears the story. The
Englishman he has come back to see what is
happen at the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>. Chiquita is so glad she
almost die with the gladness, but <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Inglés</i>, he is
see her poor face with all the scar, and he is
look, ‘Ugh!’ He say nothing, but he look the
‘Ugh!’</p>

<p>“La Bonita she hear the Englishman tell Chiquita
he must say <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">adios</i>—for the last time he
must say it. She cry, and cry, and cry, like the
heart it is to break, and she hold tight to the
coat of Milord. And then he push her away
hard, so! and tell her about the scar on her
face, and she not understand—she not believe.
So he take from his pocket <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el espejo</i>, the looking-glass,
and hold it before Chiquita!</p>

<p>“La Bonita she hear the great scream and run
quick to Chiquita. She find her on the floor
like one who is dead. The Englishman he is not
there—he is gone, but on the floor is the devil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
looking-glass. La Bonita made the curse, and
crush the glass into the thousand pieces, so! If
the Englishman he had not gone she sure would
have kill him, that old woman! She with the
poniard could aim true, that Bonita, and for
the blood of Milord was she thirsty.</p>

<p>“When he have the work to do, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Mexicano</i>
make not the hurry, but when he must kill his
enemy, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, then does he never say <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">mañana</i>—the
to-morrow. To-day is the time he must kill.</p>

<p>“Juan stayed not long at the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>. He
leave Chiquita with the old woman, and saddle
his mustang and ride—swift as the bird flies,
rode Juan. The <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i> they tell him the
Englishman he have ride through Sonora, and
so Juan he go that way.</p>

<p>“Does <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Señor</i> know where is the ferry on the
Stanislaus?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I know the place well.”</p>

<p>“Then, the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i> he will remember that the
mountains are at the ferry high, very high and
steep like the wall. The Stanislaus in the
spring is so swift that in it a man could not live
one second. The rocks, ah! <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>, the rocks in
the canyon of the Stanislaus they are plenty,
and they are sharp and cruel.</p>

<p>“It was not then as now. There was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
ferry, and one must cross by a foot-bridge. The
freshet of the spring-time it had washed the
bridge away. Very high was then the Stanislaus!
When the foot-bridge it was go, one
must wait, and wait, and wait—he must wait
for the going down of the water and for the
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">mineros</i> a new bridge to build.</p>

<p>“In the cabin of a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">minero</i> away up on the
mountain side the Englishman was wait for
the water to go down and the bridge to be
built. Here it was that Juan find him.</p>

<p>“He could fight, could that cursed <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Inglés</i>,
and he was so strong that in his hands only a
child was that little Juan! But the boy he
have the courage, and the right—and, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>,
he have the poniard. It is the poniard that
makes the strength as nothing.</p>

<p>“In the cabin of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">minero</i> the fight began,
and so weak was Juan in the hands of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Inglés</i>
that he was by him push through the door and
to the edge of the canyon. It is very deep,
that canyon, and to the bottom a very long way,
and Juan he know what happen if he is not
quick and sure.</p>

<p>“The wrist of Juan it is not strong, and his
enemy he hold it tight in his hand, so! But,
when the Englishman he take the boy around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the waist for throw him over the side of the
canyon, his foot it make the slip and he fall
back! As he fall he let go the wrist of Juan!</p>

<p>“Ah! now for Milord is there no more chance!
He must sure die! Quick, like the rattlesnake,
struck the boy! One! Two! Three!—five times
he bury the knife in the Englishman!</p>

<p>“And when the Englishman fall limp on the
ground, Juan is cover thick with the hot red
blood. It have spurt, and spurt—all over him
it have spurt!</p>

<p>“The Englishman he is not yet so dead that
he does not understand when Juan say: ‘My
Chiquita, she have send her love to the Milord
who was so kind as to show to her in the looking-glass
her face.’</p>

<p>“And then Juan laugh in the man’s face as
he die.</p>

<p>“When the Englishman he was no more, Juan
roll and roll him to the edge of the canyon. He
was not strong for the lift, but he could make
the push and the roll of the body. When the
body was at the edge, Juan make one grand
push and crash! over the Englishman go!</p>

<p>“Perhaps <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">el Señor</i> he not <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">comprende</i>—he
have not the hot blood of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">un Español</i>. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
maybe, he too have enemies, and knows the hate,
and the feelings of Juan can understand.</p>

<p>“Never was music so sweet to the ear of that
little Juan, as the sound of the dead Englishman
making the fall. Every time the body it
strike the rocks, it bound off like the ball, and
spatter much blood! Very beautiful to the
eyes of Juan was the red trail of the body on the
canyon side.</p>

<p>“When the body of Milord reach the bottom,
he look no more like a man—he is like he is
blown to the mince-meat by the blast of powder.
He fall into the Stanislaus in many pieces,
splash! splash! and when Juan saw this, he was
happy—<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Dios!</i> for the one minute he forget.</p>

<p>“Of the story of Chiquita there is not much
more to tell, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Señor</i>. When Juan was get back
to the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">hacienda</i>, she was still not know anybody.
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">El Medico</i> say she have of the brain a bad
sickness. She live, but she no more can see—she
is blind!</p>

<p>“And never has Chiquita remembered—<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Gracios
à Dios!</i></p>

<p>“Not long was it before the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">rancheria</i> of the
Salvias is go to ruin. They all go away, the
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vaqueros</i> and the women. La Bonita, she stay
like the faithful dog till she die. And then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
was Chiquita alone—alone, till she have found
Ramon.”</p>

<p>Here the story-teller gazed tenderly toward
the door of the herder’s cabin, where in the
quiet shadows just within, sat a pathetic white-haired
figure.</p>

<p>“But what became of Juan?” I asked.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar light in the Mexican’s
eyes as he replied:</p>

<p>“Long, long ago he die—that little Juan.
It was well that he die, for when Ramon came,
then was there no more need of Juan. Then,
too, my poor Chiquita did not know, and why
was it then that Juan should live?”</p>

<h2 id="A_DEAD_IDEAL">A DEAD IDEAL<br />

<span class="subhead">A ROMANCE OF THE DISSECTING ROOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I had been practising medicine for some years,
and had grown tired of the hard daily grind of
the general practitioner. I longed for a vacation,
but medicine is a hard task mistress and
with the busy physician economy of time is so
essential that his so-called “rest” is usually
merely a change of work. I felt that it must
be so with me, and resolved to hie me to some
of the eastern centers of medical teaching and
take a post graduate course in several special
subjects. Polyclinics and post graduate schools
being then unknown, I went to New York and
matriculated at one of that city’s famous
schools, one which had attained a high reputation
for practical bedside instruction and
abundant clinical material.</p>

<p>It was with all the enthusiasm of a school
boy, that I enrolled my name upon the college
roster and settled down to earnest work in the
hospital wards and dissecting rooms.</p>

<p>As I was desirous of mingling with my classmates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
as much as possible, and was not
averse to a certain degree of practical economy,
I formed a combination with three undergraduates,
who were recommended to me as
desirable associates, and became a guest of a
medical students’ boarding house—an establishment
characterized by abundant opportunities
for the study of entomology and the effects of
prolonged fasting upon the human body, rather
than by the abundance and variety of its
larder. As was the custom among medical
students, we clubbed together and occupied a
large single room—none too elaborately furnished,
but very comfortable withal, and made
rather attractive by a large, old fashioned fireplace.</p>

<p>My room-mates were most agreeable associates,
although not altogether harmonious in
tastes and methods of study. Two were young
Southerners—men of superior attainments, but
typic ladies’ men, and fond of social dissipation
and excitement. Both were possessed of some
means, and had adopted our mode of living
because of social and bohemian instincts rather
than from motives of economy. Time was an
unimportant factor with them, hence they
rarely suffered from over-study, although they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
were often the worse for the wear and tear of
social dissipation. If ever there was a well
matched pair of college cronies it was my young
friends, Will Richardson and Charles Favell.</p>

<p>The fourth member of our circle, Harold
Parkyn, was about my own age, and as different
from our jovial room-mates as possible. He
had been an artist, it seems, and an unappreciated
one, which was no fault of his, for he
had talent that fell but little short of genius.
Despairing of success in his chosen profession
and abhorring commercial pursuits, he had entered
medicine at a rather late period in life.</p>

<p>I have rarely met a man so ill adapted by
nature to medicine as was Parkyn. He was a
fine, athletic, handsome fellow, with a clear cut,
refined and classical face, and magnificent dark
eyes which evidenced a temperament far too
esthetic, and emotional faculties too exalted
and sensitive to withstand the physical and
mental strain incidental to intimate association
with human suffering. His first visit to the
dissecting room was harrowing to witness, and
it was weeks before he made an attempt to
qualify in practical anatomy. At his first
surgical clinic he fainted outright. A large
part of the disagreeable features of caring for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
the sick filled him with disgust. And yet,
Parkyn was plucky; his was not a spirit to be
easily discouraged, and he applied himself
persistently to the task of subduing his finer
feelings and acquiring the proverbial callosity
of the medical student—an effort in which he
most signally failed.</p>

<p>Parkyn was not only of a delicately sensitive
nervous organization, but he was rather peculiar
in his ways. Affable at times—when his chums
were indulging in jollity—he was generally one
of the most reserved and taciturn men I have
ever met; especially was he unsocial in the
presence of ladies. So noticeable was this
peculiarity that the young women of the household
had dubbed him “Old Crusty”—which
disturbed his serenity not at all, even when
Richardson and Favell, in a spirit of mischief
and with great show of formality, adopted the
sobriquet applied to him by the ladies. In
grave and solemn caucus these young gentlemen
decided that Parkyn was a confirmed
woman hater, and deservedly doomed to die
an old bachelor. Their favorite occupation
was the reading of love letters which they
pretended to have received, and the exhibition
of photographs of pretty girls to “Old Crusty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Being a practitioner, and therefore concededly
the oracle of our little student family, I was a
sort of balance wheel to the party, standing
between the occasional over-exuberance of Richardson
and Favell on the one hand, and the
extreme sensitiveness of Parkyn on the other.</p>

<p>One evening as we were all sitting before the
fireplace enjoying our after-dinner pipes, Favell
brought out from the recesses of his wonderfully
productive pocket, a photograph of a most
beautiful woman, and with a fine show of
counterfeit embarrassment, exhibited it as “The
picture of a very dear friend of mine, down home—just
received this morning. Very charming
girl—particular friend of my sister’s,” etc. etc.</p>

<p>The picture was certainly beautiful, and if
Favell was telling the truth he had reason to be
proud of the charming young woman’s acquaintance,
but as I looked at the photograph, I
fancied I remembered having seen it before, in
a stationer’s shop. I made no comment, however,
and Favell proceeded to launch the
arrows of his wit at Parkyn.</p>

<p>“Say, old man, here is something that ought
to stir your blood at last! How can you remain
a woman hater and know that there are such
charming creatures on this old planet of ours as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
Miss—Ahem!—the original of this photograph?
Ah! your eyes are actually growing green with
envy. You dear old stick, you! Has it been
merely a slight touch of sour grapes after all?
Tell me, old fellow, did you ever see anything
so beautiful as this face? Did you ever know
a lovelier girl?”</p>

<p>Parkyn rose from his chair, and with a
mournful expression replied, “One only, my
dear boy, and she—but pardon me,” he said,
coloring up, “you well know that the subject
of ladies is one which—bores me. I must
leave such things to social butterflies like yourself
and our mutual friend Richardson here.
And, by the way, gentlemen, I must hie myself
to a subject even more distasteful than that of
woman in the abstract. I promised Professor
Van Buren that I would finish that abominable
dissection of the upper extremity to-night.
You see that the trend of Favell’s conversation
has driven me to extremities. Yes, thank God!
to my last extremity.” Saying which he withdrew.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, boys,” I said, after Parkyn
had gone. “You mustn’t tease our friend so
outrageously. If I am not mistaken you hit
him on a tender point just now, and he is far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
too sensitive and high-strung to always take
your badinage so good naturedly as he did
to-night. I suspect that Harold Parkyn is
quite as human as the rest of us and that he—well,
who knows that he may not be bitterly
mourning over the grave of buried hopes?
No, boys, you must let him alone. You may
be inflicting pain upon him.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, doctor!” exclaimed Favell, “I
never thought of that. I’ll just bet the dear
old fellow has had a love affair. And it hasn’t
turned out right; that’s what’s the matter. I’ll
apologize to him as soon as he returns.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a fine mess you’ll make of it!”
said Richardson. “You would better let well
enough alone. We’ll both have a little sense
and delicacy hereafter. To tell the truth, I
have for some time been a little ashamed of
my part in our chaffing, and I’m only too glad
to reform.”</p>

<p>Parkyn was very thoughtful for several days
after the affair of the photograph, and even
more reserved than usual. The boys kept
their promises and did not again attempt to
banter him. I fancied that he understood the
studious politeness and affectionate consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
with which he was subsequently treated,
although there was no comment.</p>

<p>Several weeks later, Parkyn and myself
chanced to be alone together and, as is likely
to be the case among young professional men,
our talk drifted into a discussion of our aims and
ambitions in life. In the course of the conversation
I quite naturally commented upon the
wide variance between Parkyn’s former profession
and the one in the study of which he was
then engaged.</p>

<p>“It has always puzzled me to understand, I
said, how a man of your artistic temperament
and admitted ability, could ever have deserted
the profession of art for that of medicine.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Parkyn, “you have doubtless
forgotten the fact which I long ago frankly
stated to our mutual friends and yourself,
that I was not highly appreciated by the public
and finally despaired of success—not in making
a living, for I could by dint of strong exertion
do that—but in attaining the position in my
profession which I felt was justly my due. I,
myself, often wonder why I finally selected
medicine as my field of labor, but I couldn’t
sell groceries; the law wouldn’t do at all, and
the ministry was out of the question, so there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
seemed to be nothing but medicine left.”
Parkyn sighed, and remained for some moments
dreamily gazing into the fireplace and listlessly
poking at the glowing coals with the tongs.</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow,” I said, “you have
selected a profession that is nearly as difficult
as art, so far as winning fame and financial
success is concerned, and moreover, one which
has by comparison no features of attractiveness.
You will pardon me if I also say that
medicine is a profession to which your sensitive
organization is but poorly adapted.”</p>

<p>Parkyn arose and nervously paced the floor.
He finally paused and facing me said, “Doctor,
I realize the truth of what you say only too
keenly, and what is more I detest your profession
so far as I have gone. I have, however,
determined not only to overcome my repugnance
to it, but to blunt by sheer force of will
the peculiarities of organization to which you
have alluded. Distasteful as it is, medicine
is delightful by comparison with the hell into
which my chosen profession, art, finally precipitated
me. Ye gods, man! You do not realize
what—but pshaw! this is not interesting to
you, and besides, I never talk of myself.”</p>

<p>“See here, Parkyn,” I said, “it might be far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
better for you to talk about yourself a little,
especially to one who understands you—as I
think I do. I have often suspected that there
was a story connected with your change of
profession and from the best of motives I am
anxious to hear it. Come now, old man, out
with it—I am as interested and sympathetic as
you please, and as deep and silent as a well.”</p>

<p>Parkyn reflected for a moment and then
replied, “I am quite sure you understand me
much better than most of my friends, but I do
not fancy being thought ridiculous, even by
you, and my story might seem absurd to a man
of your philosophic and rather lymphatic temperament.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” I exclaimed, “I’m not so
lymphatic as you seem to think. Philosophy
puts a check on the impulses of the heart, while
art lets them roam fancy free, yet human nature
is the same in both philosopher and artist, so
fire away, old fellow; I’m all ears—evolutionary
relics you know.”</p>

<p>Parkyn leaned languidly against the corner
of the mantel, his chin resting upon his hands
and began:</p>

<p>“The details of my career up to the date of
the circumstances that impelled me to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
the profession for which nature adapted me,
are commonplace. My life was that of the
average poor boy of artistic tastes and talents,
who fights his way to the attainment of a
thorough professional training. By hard work,
I succeeded in getting enough money together
to enable me to study with the most celebrated
masters of Europe. I finally settled down in
my native city, Boston, and after many trials
and vicissitudes, was in due time in a fair way to
earn a respectable living, although fame was by
no means beating her angelic wings against the
windows of my studio. It was too near the roof,
I fear,” and Parkyn smiled somewhat bitterly.</p>

<p>“It so happened that the society of artists
of which I eventually became a member, instituted
a yearly exhibition of paintings patterned
after the Paris Salon. As an act of extreme
condescension I was especially invited by the
directors of the exhibition to contribute. The
invitation was gladly accepted and I promptly
began casting about for a suitable theme—a
matter that often constitutes the most difficult
part of the artist’s labors. The department
of painting in which I was particularly adept
was the study of the nude and I quite naturally
resolved to produce something in the line of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
favorite work. And then came the search for
a model.</p>

<p>“Contrary to the popular notion, a satisfactory
model is a very scarce commodity.
The human form divine rarely stands the keen
professional criticism of the eye artistic. A
picture is oftener the composite of several
models than the actual delineation of one. The
arms and shoulders of one, the feet of another,
and the torso of still another may be required.
Several months passed away and although the
time for the exhibition was dangerously near,
I had not yet found what I sought. As you
may imagine, I was in despair, for having set
my heart upon a certain subject for my picture,
I was loth to abandon it, for another of less
interest. And now comes the strangest part
of my story—the part which I fear is hardly
materialistic enough for you, my dear doctor,”
and Parkyn hesitated.</p>

<p>“Go on; go on!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I had always been an ardent student of
the classics, and was in the habit of reading for
an hour or two before retiring. In selecting
a book almost at random from the modest
little collection of odds and ends—by courtesy
my library—I happened one evening to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
hold of an old treatise on mythology. While
reading of the gods and goddesses therein
described, and admiring the artistic opportunities
afforded by the social circle in which the
heathen deities moved, I fell asleep in my
chair, and dreaming, found that for which I
had vainly sought in my waking hours—my
model.</p>

<p>“You as a practical physician will doubtless
attribute my dream to the direct impression
made upon my brain by the character of the
book I had been reading, and I must admit
that my experience had certain features which
would justify such an opinion, yet I feel nevertheless
that my dream model had a basis of
reality.</p>

<p>“I seemed to be in the midst of a vast garden—the
most beautiful I had ever seen. The
flowers and shrubs surpassed all forms with
which I was familiar. Hovering over the rare
and many hued exotics were gorgeous butterflies
and humming birds, to which no description
could possibly do justice. The air was
redolent with the odor of the blossoms and
vibrant with the songs of rare birds and the
melodious strains of unseen musical instruments.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
‘Surely,’ I thought, ‘this must be
Paradise.’</p>

<p>“As I stood gazing enraptured upon the
sensuous things surrounding me I became
conscious that I was not alone. The garden was
peopled with forms, among which I recognized
some of the more familiar of the mythologic
deities whom I had just left within the
covers of my book. As these luminous beings
passed and repassed me, I perceived that there
was some central object of attraction. They
appeared to be gathering about a beautiful
fountain that stood, half hidden by flowering
plants and foliage, in the center of the garden.
Feeling that my human curiosity was justified
by that which even the celestial beings about
me were exhibiting, I approached the spot and
there beheld a scene which astonished and delighted
me beyond measure.</p>

<p>“Just within the spray of the fountain that
glittered and sparkled with surprising brilliancy,
showing combinations of colors which I had
never before seen, was a golden, shell-like couch.
Upon, or rather within this couch, lay the sleeping
form of a most beautiful woman! Gazing
upon this lovely creature, I was not surprised
that the strange beings about me were attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
by her beauty. My own artistic eye was
fairly entranced. I saw at once that the object
of my admiration was different from the
beings who peopled the celestial garden. She
was human—although the loveliest of womankind.</p>

<p>“My first feeling of mingled awe and admiration
was soon replaced by a most gratifying
sense of triumph. I had found what was
to me a much desired object—a perfect model
for my picture! With feverish haste I drew
sketch book and pencil from my pocket and
endeavored to outline the only perfect female
form I had ever seen.</p>

<p>“As is usual in the dream state, I found that
I had lost all power of doing those things which
were part of my daily life. I could not draw
a single line; my artistic talent and indeed,
even the power of voluntary motion necessary
in drawing, was wholly gone. You may imagine
how I despaired. Everything was real
to me, and my inability to sketch the model
for which I had so long sought in vain, was
most distressing, so distressing that I awoke.</p>

<p>“I was greatly impressed by my dream, but
inclined to smile at the keen disappointment
that I felt on awaking. The peculiar circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
under which I had found my model
were naturally aggravating, but I consoled
myself with the reflection that dream pictures
are not very substantial after all, and that even
though the sketch which I attempted had been
made, my sketch book would have been rather
evanescent. It certainly would have been lost
on the way back to earth.</p>

<p>“Whether because of the vivid impression
the vision of the female loveliness made upon
me, I cannot say—you are a practical psychologist
and should know more of such matters
than I—but my dream repeated itself in every
detail the following night. Even my unsuccessful
endeavor to sketch the beautiful woman
was faithfully reproduced, and I again awoke
to the consciousness of keen disappointment
at the loss of a long sought artistic opportunity.</p>

<p>“A detailed reproduction of a dream, is as
you know, not common, but I felt intuitively
that a further repetition would quite likely
occur and when I retired on the second night
following the original dream, it was with a
fixed determination to so impress the vision
of loveliness I had seen upon my mind, that I
could from memory alone, utilize the model
which had come to me in such a strange fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
“The wished for dream occurred precisely as
on the two previous nights, and I remember
making a most earnest endeavor to photograph
the wonderful model upon my memory—an
effort in which I was only too successful. When
I awoke, my model was so vividly pictured in
my mind that the work of reproducing her upon
canvas was no more difficult than if her living
form had been actually before me.</p>

<p>“And then came the disaster of my life. It
was the story of Pygmalion and Galatea over
again. I began my work with the enthusiasm
of the artist, and completed it with the ardor of
the man. I fell in love with my own creation!
The self-confessed misogynist, who had never
been susceptible to the real in womankind, became
enslaved by an ideal from dreamland
which my brush had metamorphosed into something
material. I finally became intoxicated
with the idea that my model must herself have
a material being; that the feminine perfection
I had seen in the vision was but the dream picture
of a real personage—a fair woman who
actually lived in the flesh!</p>

<p>“My picture was done! It was destined to
be my last and, like the song of the dying swan,
it was my masterpiece. But I had no longer a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
thought of the exhibition. I became infatuated
with the idea that through some occult and
mysterious influence I had had the opportunity
of utilizing as a model the fairest of womankind.
It was not by her own volition that she became
my model. To hang her picture at the exhibition
would be a crime. The most beautiful
model in the whole world should not be gazed
upon by the vulgar herd. She was mine, and
mine alone. She was real; she lived, and one
day we should meet, and <span class="locked">then—</span></p>

<p>“Ah, me! Was it not thus that Aphrodite
breathed the spark of life, the material essence
of reality into the ivory form of Galatea? Such
is the power of that worship of the ideal that
the Philistine calls love, over the human heart!</p>

<p>“There is little more to be told. My picture
became a shrine at which I worshipped by day
and dreamed by night. Its possession was
happiness. The failure to find the original was
the acme of misery. I lost all interest in the
art that had created the painting, and the
very thought of devoting the talent which had
developed my ideal to subjects that must
ever be less worthy became abhorrent to me.
My all of art, my all of life, my loftiest aspirations
were there in the beautiful painting, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
model for which had come to me in my dreams.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear doctor!” exclaimed Parkyn, as
he extended his hand imploringly towards me,
“do not laugh at me. Be something more
than a man of science, something more than a
materialist, and do not discourage me when I
say that I know that my ideal lives, know that
somehow, somewhere, I am to meet her!</p>

<p>“You have heard my story, my dear friend.
You are the first to whom I have told it, and
shall be the last.”</p>

<p>“My dear Parkyn,” I said, when my friend
had finished his story, “the very essence of
materialism itself, should respect the artistic
and emotional nature that could develop such
an experience as you have had. I am, myself,
by no means so materialistic as you suppose.
We have not yet solved the mysteries of psychology.
We know nothing of the workings of
human affinities, and there are those, even
among us men of science, who are not altogether
blind to the possibilities of the occult. Men
have been shattered upon the rocks and shoals
of ideality before, and will be again. Not all
could have so pure and fair an ideal as you have
described. Your vision was extraordinary, and
although as a physician I might descant to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
on the relation of over-work and lack of exercise
to figments of the imagination, still as a man,
and one in whom the finer sensibilities are not
yet dead, I must acknowledge that I not only
sympathize with you, but I—well, I myself
suspect that there is somewhere a substantial
foundation for your dream. It is by no means
impossible that you may one day find your
model, and, my dear fellow, I sincerely hope
you will.”</p>

<p>Parkyn grasped my hand warmly, and stood
in silence for a moment, then, with an expression
of gratification and happiness such as I had
never before seen on his face, he said slowly:</p>

<p>“You do, indeed, understand me, doctor.
Your medical philosophy is tinctured with just
enough of the fire of romance, your heart has
just enough of the emotional attributes of the
true artist, to enable you to be something more
than a mere compounder and prescriber of
drugs. I understand now, why you have a
penchant for psychology. Wise is he who hath
read the chapter on hearts in the book of human
life!”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The end of the college term was drawing near,
and even Favell and Richardson had settled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
down to something like earnest work preparatory
to examinations. I had just finished my
dissections, as had my room-mates several
weeks before, hence had no occasion to visit that
gloomy and dismal room above stairs known
as the hall of anatomy. When, therefore, we
heard one day of a marvellously interesting
subject that had just been brought over from
Blackwell’s Island, our interest was not especially
excited. The dissecting room is by no
means haunted by students who have finished
their prescribed course in anatomy. It seems,
however, that one of Favell’s friends had
induced him to go up to the dissecting-room
one morning to inspect the anatomic wonder,
which I had understood somewhat vaguely,
was the body of a remarkably beautiful woman.
Parkyn, Richardson and myself were just
preparing to go to dinner, meanwhile wondering
what had become of the ever-hungry Favell,
when that worthy broke into the room in a state
of great excitement, crying, “Say, boys, you
just ought to see the subject that’s come in from
the Island! Gee, whiz! but it’s a beauty—the
handsomest thing in the shape of a woman that
ever was born! Why, half the artists and all
the newspaper men in New York have been up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
to see it. They’re all crazy over it. You boys
must go up and look at it to-night, and if you
don’t say that body is the most beautiful thing
you ever saw, I’ll buy the dinners for the crowd.
I mean you, especially, Parkyn. I suspect that
you are much cleverer than any of those daubers
who have seen it, and I know you’ll revel in the
beauties of what might have been an artist’s
model.”</p>

<p>Richardson and myself promptly agreed to
visit the nine days wonder, but it was with
extreme difficulty that I induced Parkyn to
accompany us. When he did finally yield to
my entreaties he turned a deaf ear to my urgent
request that he take some sketching materials
with him.</p>

<p>“You well know, doctor,” he said, “that I
have reformed. I never sketch. Sketching is
a lost art so far as I am concerned. You forget,
my dear friend—”</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered, and was silent. I
alone understood the sentiments that inspired
his refusal.</p>

<p>Evening came, and our little party proceeded
to the chamber of horrors which, as I supposed,
Favell’s boyish nonsense had converted into a
mortuary of dead female beauty. I more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
half suspected a practical joke. My young
friend was much given to such diversions.</p>

<p>Arriving at the dissecting room, we found a
large congregation of men standing about one
of the tables. Here and there I could see
several who, sketch-book in hand, were busily
at work utilizing what they evidently considered
an artistic opportunity. Favell and Richardson,
boylike, pushed their way through the crowd,
while Parkyn and I leisurely brought up the rear.
I heard the demonstrator of anatomy <span class="locked">say—</span></p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, we must begin our dissection.
We have already devoted too much time
to sentiment.”</p>

<p>As the professor poised his gleaming scalpel
over the body, Favell exclaimed, “Wait just a
moment, sir, please, here comes Parkyn.”</p>

<p>The professor, with whom the cultured and
artistic Parkyn was a favorite, stayed his hand,
and with knife upraised, waited. The crowd
made way for my friend, and I stepped aside
to allow him to pass ahead of me.</p>

<p>There are some events which are so replete
with action and dramatic excitement that no
one, however observing, can faithfully describe
them. Note upon this point the conflicting
testimony of disinterested eye-witnesses in murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
trials. Such was the scene which followed
the introduction of Parkyn to the presence of
that body.</p>

<p>There was a yell like that of a maniac, a
swift rush, the collision of two bodies, a heavy
fall! As I sprang quickly into the midst of the
swaying, trampling, excited crowd about the
table, the demonstrator, pale and frightened,
was just rising from the floor, his scalpel still in
his trembling hand and his face cut and bleeding
where his assailant had struck him in the first
mad rush. Parkyn was still lying on the floor,
and on endeavoring with the assistance of
several students to raise him to his feet, I saw
that he was insensible. Upon his temple was
a deep, jagged gash where his head had come in
contact with the corner of the table.</p>

<p>Temporary emotional insanity in a man of
highly wrought nervous organization was the
universal verdict, and it was with genuine
sorrow and regret that poor Parkyn’s fellow
students took him to the hospital, apparently
in a lifeless condition.</p>

<p>But Parkyn did not die—his skull was not
fractured. This was very fortunate, in the light
of subsequent events, for he developed symptoms
of meningitis, and hovered between life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
and death for many weeks. I remained in the
city to care for him and was a proud and happy
man when I was able to pronounce him out of
danger.</p>

<p>How poor Parkyn raved as his fever and
delirium rose! No one but myself knew the
story of his wild, ecstatic visions and apparently
erratic talk—and I said nothing.</p>

<p>During his illness I had occasion to open
Parkyn’s trunk. While rummaging about in
search of his wearing apparel, I found the pictured
dream of his artist days. I knew then
how powerful was the shock that made my poor
friend, in intent, at least, a murderer. I care
not what the world may say of the vagaries of
foolish old doctors and the maunderings of aged,
would-be philosophers; I care not who may
doubt;—I held in my hands the picture of the
beautiful subject of the dissecting hall. Beautiful
beyond the power of pen or tongue to portray,
realistic to a living, breathing, sentient degree, I
beheld the portrait of the original of the lifeless
clay which was the central figure of the romance
of the dissecting room.</p>

<p>When Parkyn recovered from his illness his
mind was a blank, so far as his artistic training
and the romance of the picture and corpse were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
concerned. I concealed the picture, deeming it
unwise to revive dangerous memories in his
mind. It remained in my possession for several
years. I kept it hidden because it seemed a
sacrilege to permit it to be gazed upon by the
eyes of the commonplace. My office was finally
destroyed by fire, and I confess that I was not
sorry when I discovered that the trunk which
contained the painting was not among the properties
saved from the flames.</p>

<p>Parkyn became a plodding practitioner in a
little country town in New York State. I
visited him some years later, and found that
his ideals were represented by a short, dumpy,
motherly, little red-headed wife and half a
dozen tow-headed, freckle-faced youngsters that
looked for all the world like turkey eggs and
jack o’ lanterns.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="A_MATTER_OF_PROFESSIONAL">A MATTER OF PROFESSIONAL SECRECY</h2>
</div>

<p>The day had been a trying one. Four capital
operations, between the hours of eight and
ten in the morning, fifteen minutes for washing
up and changing back from the rubber and
white duck of the operating room to my ordinary
habiliments, and with my usual fear that I
was still redolent with the fumes of ether and
that sickish odor of the combined horrors of
blood and iodoform, I was off for my clinic at
the medical school as fast as my team of thoroughbreds
could take me.</p>

<p>A strenuous hour of teaching and, my nervous
force already nearly exhausted, although
my day’s work had just begun, I hurried to my
office, taking barely enough time <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> to
swallow a hasty lunch. And then came an afternoon
of arduous office work, with, it seemed
to me, more patients and more tough problems
and petty annoyances than usual.</p>

<p>My office hours over, I was privileged to spend
a half hour at dinner, before attending to several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
consultations. I wound up the day by calling
at the hospital and looking over the cases I had
operated in the morning, and was then driven
homeward, fairly worn out, by what was, after
all, merely an average day in the life of the college
professor.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight when I retired, congratulating
myself, meanwhile, that I had completed
and forwarded to the publisher the
last batch of MS. for my new book, and was
therefore privileged to rest my weary bones and
exhausted brain.</p>

<p>A telephone at one’s bedside is sometimes a
great convenience for the physician, but there
are occasions when to me it seems an invention
of the devil—a something devised especially to
defeat the ends of tired nature—a sort of Nemesis,
which pursues one into the very midst
of dreamland. When I am as tired as I was on
this particular night, the ringing of my telephone
bell awakens me with a sudden physical and mental
shock that sets my every nerve a quiver, and
makes my heart beat like a trip hammer for
many minutes.</p>

<p>With the bell still ringing with impudent insistency,
I found myself sitting bolt upright in
bed and, I freely confess, swearing to the limit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
of my vocabulary of the profane. Having sufficiently
identified myself to the party at the
other end of the line he said excitedly, “Doctor,
you are wanted at once at No. — B— Street. A
man is dying. For God’s sake, hurry!”</p>

<p>And I stood not on the order of my going.</p>

<p>A handsome young man, apparently about
twenty-five years of age, lay writhing in the
most horrible agony, and crying, “Water, for
God’s sake give me some water! I am burning
up inside! My stomach and bowels are on fire!”</p>

<p>From time to time frightful paroxysms of
vomiting came on, with the ejection of a greenish
fluid mixed with blood. His sufferings were
frightful to witness. He complained of cold
shivers, and his teeth chattered like those of a
man with an ague chill. His skin was yellow
and parchment like, and his face drawn and cadaverous.
His eyes were sunken and surrounded
by great dark rings. Their dullness was only
redeemed by the gleam of fear and horror of
death that shone in their depths.</p>

<p>“Has this man ever before been ill, so far as
you know?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor,” replied an elderly woman—evidently
the landlady, for the ear marks of the
cheap boarding house were plain—“this is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
third attack of the kind, only this is the worst
one he’s had. Until a month ago he was well
and hearty. His sickness always comes on in
this way, with that funny lookin’ vomit, and
that burning in his stomach. This is the first
time there’s been any blood, though. He was
all right this morning at breakfast. He didn’t
come home to dinner, and I think he must have
eaten somethin’ that didn’t agree with him, at
one o’ them restaurants downtown.”</p>

<p>I immediately gave the poor fellow a hypodermic
of morphine and requested everybody
to leave the room. He grew easier in a few
minutes, I meanwhile administering antidotes
for what seemed clearly a case of arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>“My friend,” I said, “you have taken arsenic.
Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he moaned, shaking his head.
“Julie, Julie!” Further than this I could get
nothing intelligible out of him.</p>

<p>Another paroxysm of that awful pain came
on, and I was obliged to resort to another hypodermic.
This paroxysm left him almost pulseless.
His skin grew cold and damp, and his
eyes assumed that glazed and set appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
which means but one thing to the professional
eye. My patient was sinking fast.</p>

<p>I quickly administered stimulants hypodermically
and then called the sick man’s friends to
his bedside.</p>

<p>“This man is dying,” I said quietly to the landlady.
“He has but a few minutes longer to live.
See if you can get him to say anything about
himself.”</p>

<p>The woman spoke to the dying man and shook
him gently, in a vain effort to arouse his attention.
He revived a little for a fleeting moment
and shook his head feebly, muttering in barely
audible tones, “Tired—so tired—sleepy.”</p>

<p>This was the last flicker of his candle of life. I
could no longer find the pulse at the wrist. The
heart sounds grew feebler and feebler and finally
ceased altogether. The face grew gray and
ghastly. The eyes were set and dully staring
and the jaw relaxed. There was a last convulsive
expansion and contraction of the chest and
a gasping, strident, laryngeal sound as the breath
finally left the poor fellow’s body forever. My
unfortunate patient was dead!</p>

<p>“What was the matter with him, Doctor?”
asked in chorus the people about the bedside.</p>

<p>Long years of experience had brought discretion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
to this particular warhorse, and so I replied,</p>

<p>“Acute gastritis.”</p>

<p>I did not propose to tell all I thought I knew,
or to issue premature bulletins. I wanted time
to think. I scented mystery here, and perhaps
crime, and let him who will condemn my taste
as a depraved one, such things have always had
an overpowering fascination for me.</p>

<p>I knew that some hours would elapse before
I would be called upon for a death certificate,
and much could be done in the way of investigation
in that time. I resolved to keep my own
counsel and allow future developments to determine
whether or when I should place the
case in the hands of the coroner.</p>

<p>But, was the case one of murder or suicide?
This question I proposed to solve myself, if I
could. I could at least try to do so, before turning
the matter over to the authorities. If it
were suicide there might be reasons satisfactory
to my conscience why I should keep my counsel.
There are times when the physician is justified
in closing and forever locking the door of the
closet that contains the grinning family skeleton.
I may be telling tales out of school, but I am not
ashamed to say that this has been done by men
whom I revere. All honor to the profession that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
has the courage to protect the fair name of its
<em>clientele</em>!</p>

<p>Of course, I had no intention of concealing
what I knew, if the case should prove to be at
all doubtful, nor was there in this particular case
much chance of any circumstances existing which
would be likely to impel me to conceal a suicide.
Should the case prove to be a murder, I resolved
to at once notify the coroner, no matter what the
circumstances might be.</p>

<p>I suspected from the history of the case
that it was murder, not suicide, with which I had
to deal.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>One by one the friends and curious neighbors
of my late patient filed silently out of the room,
till none remained save the landlady and myself.
Mrs. Wharton was evidently a simple, kind-hearted
creature, who had known sorrow of her own
and had had experience. She quietly set about
performing the last sad offices for the dead,
whilst I proceeded to critically inspect the dead
man’s surroundings.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wharton removed the pillow from beneath
the head of the corpse. As she did so a
letter fell from the pillow upon the floor, unnoticed
save by myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
The interest excited in my mind by that letter
may be imagined. Here was a possible answer
to the question I had been asking myself. The
opportunity must not be lost. Under the pretext
of helping Mrs. Wharton, I succeeded in
placing my foot squarely over the letter. To
drop and regain my handkerchief, restoring it
to my pocket with that much to be desired missive
concealed in its folds, was sufficiently easy,
even for an amateur.</p>

<p>Before departing for home, I made a few ostensibly
casual inquiries regarding the dead man.
It appeared that he was a comparatively new
boarder in the house, and had said that he had
been in the city but a short time. He had not
obtained any regular employment, but seemed
to have plenty of money, Mrs. Wharton stated,
adding, “He was an awfully nice young man,
Mr. Peyton was, and everybody in the house
liked him.”</p>

<p>“Do you know whether or not he was married?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, no, he wasn’t married!” exclaimed
Mrs. Wharton. “I’m quite sure he wasn’t, because
he had a sweetheart—such a pretty girl,
too. That’s her picture on the mantel.”</p>

<p>I picked up the photograph and found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
the landlady had spoken “by the card”—the
dead man’s sweetheart was indeed “such a pretty
girl,” of the dark Spanish type—with a face
full of life and passion.</p>

<p>“Ah,” I exclaimed to myself, “I’ll wager that
we have found ‘the woman.’ Those great dark
eyes, that massive head of ebon hair and those
full, sensuous lips seem to me to fit into this
mystery very accurately.”</p>

<p>“Where does the young woman live?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Laws, sir, I don’t know where she lives, but
I understand that she works somewhere down
town. Mr. Peyton used to call for her, so one
of the other boarders who used to be here said,
nearly every evening at closing time, at one of
them big department stores. I don’t know
which one, for sure, but I think it was the Emporium—or,
maybe, it was Wurtzinger’s.”</p>

<p>I had no doubt as to my ability to recognize
the original of the photograph. After making
a mental note of the somewhat faded inscription
upon the back, I replaced the picture upon
the mantel.</p>

<p>“To Hartley, from Julie.” Julie was the name
that the dead man had spoken, almost in his last
agony. Most assuredly I must find Julie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
As may be imagined, after my arrival
home I wasted none of the remaining precious
moments of the night in sleeping. I fairly
dashed into my study, turned on the lights,
closed and locked the door instinctively, without
rhyme or reason, and proceeded to read
that portentous letter:</p>

<p>“Hartley:—</p>

<p>“Why did you follow me to N—? Why
can you not understand? Why do you persist
in harrowing my very soul in the attempt
to bring back by force and arms what no longer
exists? I have told you, over and over
again, that I no longer love you, and that I
love another with all the strength of my being.
Of what good could it be to compel me,
as you are trying to do, to continue a <em>liaison</em>
which I have come to detest, and which, had I
been more worldly wise would never have been
formed? And you threaten to expose me—you,
who have nothing to lose, while I—oh,
man, man! Why can you not see? And you
say you love me, and you reproach me because
I have said in the past—that past over
which I fain would draw a veil of oblivion—that
I loved you. Yes, I did love you—to my
shame be it said, the more shame that I now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
know that the burning sentiment, the ardent
affection you have expressed for me is not
love, but the passion of the brute whose life
revolves around his own selfish gratification.
You will say this is not true, that you do love
me, that your love is of the exalted type. For
God’s sake then, do what you can to show me
that I am wrong! By that love, I implore you to
do nothing until I see you. Do not bring the
girl you have so often called your Julie, to open
shame! Oh, Hartley, be not harsh to me!
I am the most miserable wretch, the unhappiest
being on the face of the earth. Do not
drive me to desperation and death. Do not
ruin my future. Be merciful, I implore you.
In your last letter you threaten to denounce
me to my father, that you will send him my
letters. Oh, why did I ever write them?
Hartley, if my poor old father should ever
read those letters, inspired though they were
by the truest love, he would put me away from
him. He would hate me, now that I am engaged
to marry a man of whom he is very fond.
I wrote to you in all the ardor of my first love;
it was as pure and as true as it was deep, but
the world could not, would not understand. I
believed you when you said you loved me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
and it was for the love that you expressed
that I adored you. I put on paper what I
should not. Had my love been one of head
and not of heart—had I not believed you the
noblest of men, I should not now be pleading
for mercy. If my father or Mr. X—— should
see those fond letters to you, what could I expect
but a revulsion of feeling? If any other
eyes should see them, what would not be said of
me? Oh, on my bended knees I implore you
to spare me,—to spare those who love me and
whom I love with my whole soul. As you
hope for mercy on the Judgment Day, do not
inform on me—do not make my name a scandal
and a reproach! Oh, will you not keep my
secret from the world? For the sake of my
mother, for the love you bear your own, spare
me! Oh, Hartley, in God’s name hear my
prayer! I have prayed God to forgive your
cruel threats—to inspire you to spare me from
shame. For the love of Heaven, hear me!
I grow mad! I have been ill, very ill, ever
since I received your last awful, threatening
letter. I have had to resort to drugs—something
I should not have taken, and my brain
is on fire. I feel as if death itself would be
sweet. Hartley, oh, Hartley; abuse me, villify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
me, kill me if you will, but do not denounce
me! For my life I am pleading—oh, listen,
listen, for—must I say it?—for your own safety
hear me. I cannot stand everything. Do
not drive me to madness and death—or worse!
Have pity on her whom you once called—your
Julie.”</p>

<p>As I read this heart rending missive my late
patient’s case did not seem so mysterious. I
do not hesitate to say, moreover, that the memory
of his last horrible agonies was pleasanter
to contemplate than it had been.</p>

<p>“The man who inspired that letter,” I exclaimed
aloud, “never committed suicide. He
was not man enough. That fellow died like
a poisoned rat in a hole,—if the evidence counts
for anything.”</p>

<p>Having thus become more reconciled to the
death of the late Mr. Peyton, I was less inclined
than ever to be in haste in promoting
any legal intermeddling with what had begun
to appear a just dispensation of Providence.
But I was nevertheless determined to see the
matter to its conclusion. I was bound to find
the hand that had “poisoned the rat.” I could
decide what course to pursue afterward. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
confident that I knew for whom I must look,
but where? Where was “Julie?”</p>

<p>After a hurried breakfast I began my quest.
As luck would have it I decided to visit the Emporium
first. I confess that when I entered the
colossal establishment and saw its large number
of female employes I began to fear that,
with only the given name of the person I was
seeking and a mental reproduction of her photograph
to guide me, my task was liable to be
something like the proverbial search for the
needle in the haystack.</p>

<p>For more than two hours I strolled about the
Emporium, covertly studying the faces of the
women clerks and affecting an indifference which
I did not feel, without seeing any one who could
by any possibility have been taken for the original
of the picture. Black hair and dark eyes—the
possessors of which were not seldom beautiful—were
there in plenty, but none that could
be compared with those I sought.</p>

<p>I was about to go to the office of the establishment
to inquire there, under the pretext of
seeking a witness of an accident case, when I
caught sight of one of the floor walkers, a Mr.
Courtney, who chanced to be an old patient of
mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
“Ah,” I thought, “here is some one who may
help me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Courtney greeted me warmly, and replied
courteously, when I asked for a private interview,</p>

<p>“Certainly, doctor, step this way.”</p>

<p>Having seated ourselves on a sofa in an out
of the way corner of the store, I said,</p>

<p>“Mr. Courtney, for important reasons, which
I am sure it will not be necessary to give you, I
am seeking a certain young lady, who may or
may not be employed in this establishment. I
have been compelled to ask your assistance because
I have only her description to rely upon,
and know merely her given name—‘Julie.’”</p>

<p>I then proceeded to describe the young woman
of the photograph.</p>

<p>My friend smiled and said,</p>

<p>“Your task is an easy one, doctor. There’s
only one of her kind, in this establishment, at
least. Do you wish to speak to the young woman?”</p>

<p>I was somewhat taken aback by the suddenness
with which success promised to reward my
search.</p>

<p>“W—why, yes, if it would not be too much
trouble,” I replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Mr. Courtney rapped sharply for a messenger,
and one promptly appeared.</p>

<p>“Tell Miss Morales, in the lace department,
that I wish to see her here at once.”</p>

<p>The messenger departed on his mission, leaving
me wondering how I had missed seeing the
object of my quest. I recalled having lingered
for quite a while at the lace department.</p>

<p>The messenger did his errand quickly and returned.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, Miss Morales is at home sick. The
lace department manager says she hain’t been
down to the store for three or four days.”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Mr. Courtney, “come to
think of it, I haven’t seen her for several days.
I had made no especial note of her absence, however,
as there are so many women employes in
the store, and the lace department isn’t on
my floor. If you wish, doctor, I will ascertain
where she lives. We keep a record of the residences
of all our employes, you know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Courtney went to the office and returned
with a card upon which was written, “Miss
Julie Morales, No. — M— Street.”</p>

<p>After thanking my friend and asking him to
consider my inquiry as of a confidential nature,
I wended my way to the address given me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
No. — M— Street proved to be located some
distance from the business part of the city. The
house presented the semi-respectable appearance
of a boarding house of the cheaper grade.
A smirking, frowsy, freckle-faced Irish maid
opened the door in answer to my ring, and informed
me that “Miss Morales was to home” and
she “guessed,” in her room.</p>

<p>The maid ushered me into the stuffy, cookery
smelling parlor, dusted a rickety, shabby genteel,
hair-cloth covered chair with her apron, and
asked me to be seated.</p>

<p>“Who shall I be after tellin’ Miss Morales as
wants to see her?”</p>

<p>“Never mind my name. Just tell her I am
from the Emporium.”</p>

<p>The maid soon returned and informed me
that Miss Morales would be “down in a little
while.”</p>

<p>I had begun to grow somewhat restless, and
was wondering whether the fair Miss Morales
had not become suspicious and eluded me,
when there was a soft rustle of skirts in the
hall, the door opened, and there stood the
original of the photograph—hollow eyed, wan
and haggard, with deep care lines about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
mouth, but still undoubtedly “Julie,” and still
surpassingly lovely.</p>

<p>“You wished to see me, sir,” she said, in a
voice which was somewhat tremulous, and
unquestionably that of one who had suffered
much.</p>

<p>“Miss Morales, I believe.”</p>

<p>“That is my name, sir.”</p>

<p>“I owe you an apology for the little deception,”
I said, handing her my professional card.
“As you see, I am not from the Emporium,
although I obtained the address from my friend
Mr. Courtney, at that establishment.”</p>

<p>Her hand trembled as she took the card, and
she gazed at it fearfully, as though apprehensive
of danger.</p>

<p>“Shall we not be seated?” I asked, motioning
to a settee. The young woman acquiesced,
almost mechanically. Seating myself beside
her, I said:</p>

<p>“Miss Morales, while I am a total stranger
to you, I wish you would not construe my visit
and what I am about to say to you as either
impertinent or menacing to yourself. I am
here with the best of intentions, but I must
discuss with you a matter which, you may
be assured, is of vital importance to you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Anything you may say will be treated by me
as strictly confidential—as, in short, a professional
secret.”</p>

<p>She gazed at me helplessly, with the dumb,
haunting dread of impending disaster in her
beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>“You are, or have been, I believe,” I continued,
“a very close friend of Mr. Hartley
Peyton’s.”</p>

<p>The poor girl’s face became ghastly pale,
and I feared she was going to faint, as she stammered,
<span class="locked">weakly,—</span></p>

<p>“Ye—yes, sir. We are, or at least we were,
friends—we were very good friends.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I continued, “it may interest you
to know that I was called to see him professionally
last night, and found him very ill.”</p>

<p>“Then he is much better now; he is quite
recovered, is he not, doctor?” she exclaimed
eagerly, springing to her feet.</p>

<p>“I regret to say that he is not better. In
fact,” I replied, “Mr. Peyton is—”</p>

<p>“My God, doctor!” she cried, “he is not
dead?”</p>

<p>“Miss Morales, Hartley Peyton died at two
o’clock this morning.” The young woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
buried her face in her hands, and fell back upon
the settee in a state of almost total collapse.</p>

<p>“Miss Morales,” I continued, “the point
which mutually interests us is that the circumstances
surrounding Mr. Peyton’s death
were very peculiar and unusual, in fact, suspicious
in the extreme. I will go further and
state that I have formed a very definite opinion
of the cause of his death.”</p>

<p>Thrown completely off her guard by fright,
the poor girl moaned, “Oh, doctor, you surely
do not suspect that I—you surely do not
believe that I could ever have—”</p>

<p>“I am not at present expressing any views
as to the peculiar agencies which acted directly
or indirectly in causing the unfortunate
man’s demise. I have merely stated to you
the fact of his death, and that I have arrived
at a certain conclusion as to the cause of it.</p>

<p>“Miss Morales, you may place the most implicit
confidence in me in anything you may
say to me. Any communications you may
make shall be held sacred. I have not as yet
discussed the unfortunate affair with any one
but yourself. It may rest entirely with you
as to whether or not I do so hereafter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
“What do you wish me to do—what am I to
say?” she asked, faintly.</p>

<p>“Nothing here,” I replied. “Your present
surroundings are by no means favorable to
discussion of topics of vital importance, least
of all to confidential communications. I shall
therefore take the liberty of asking you to
come to my office”—I looked at my watch,
and saw that my office hours were long past
due—“at ten o’clock to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>The girl suddenly dropped her hands from
her face, straightened up in her seat, and,
with the gleam of battle in her wonderful eyes,
said, tensely,</p>

<p>“Why should I feel called upon to make an
appointment with you, an entire stranger, for
the purpose of discussing a matter which, after
all, does not in the least concern me. Mr.
Peyton’s death, and your opinion of its cause
are to me of no consequence whatever. Furthermore,
your presence here is in the highest
degree impertinent and uncalled for.”</p>

<p>“Miss Morales,” I said, quietly. “There are
several reasons why you should make and keep
the appointment I have requested. In the first
place, it is optional with me as to whether or not
the sudden death of your friend, Mr. Peyton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
shall be turned over to the coroner for investigation.
It may prove to be my duty to do so.”</p>

<p>“What do I care, whether the case is turned
over to the coroner or not?” she replied, her
jaws setting combatively.</p>

<p>“Simply because there is no telling in what
direction the investigation may lead, nor to
whom suspicion may be directed,” I retorted.</p>

<p>“Let it lead where it may, for aught I care,”
she said, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Miss Morales, I will be more to the point.
A letter was found beneath Mr. Peyton’s pillow,
which, should it fall into the coronor’s hands,
might suggest all sorts of foolish ideas to the
minds of the ignoramuses who compose the
average coronor’s jury—minds to which sentiment
is an unknown quantity. The letter was
signed, ‘Julie,’ a signature that corresponds
very accurately with one which is inscribed
on the back of a photograph of a certain young
lady that was found on the mantel in the dead
man’s room.”</p>

<p>The poor girl sank limply back upon the
settee, the picture of helpless misery. I laid
my hand gently upon her beautiful head, resting
it there for a brief moment, and then passed
quietly out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
Being somewhat versed in matters psycho-logic,
I had not the slightest doubt that the fair
Julie would keep the rather one sided appointment
made the afternoon before. I confess,
however, that her promptness surprised me a
little.</p>

<p>The clock upon my office mantel was just
striking the hour of ten, when Miss Morales
was announced. I directed my attendant to
usher her in, at the same time giving instructions
that I was not to be disturbed until further
orders.</p>

<p>As my beautiful visitor took the seat I proffered
her, I was struck by her calm, composed
demeanor. Her poise was perfect, and she
showed not the slightest trace of excitement,
but responded to my polite “Good morning,”
as if her business were of the most matter of
fact nature.</p>

<p>I leaned back in my chair, saying, “I am very
glad you concluded to call upon me, Miss
Morales, and assure you that your confidence
has not been misplaced. There is hardly any
need for preliminaries. Our business together
this morning is unpleasant at best, and the
sooner it is over the more agreeable it will be
for us both, I am sure. You doubtless have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
something to say to me apropos of our conversation
of yesterday. You will find me a good
listener—and a sympathetic one.”</p>

<p>She sat for a moment gazing out of the open
window, through which the glorious sun and
balmy air of an ideal Spring morning were
pouring, then, turning and looking me squarely
in the eyes, said, as calmly as though entering
upon a discussion of things common place:</p>

<p>“Since you left me, yesterday afternoon,
doctor, I have passed through mental and
physical agonies which, were I the worst of
criminals, should have been sufficient expiation
for anything I have ever done. I now feel that
nothing which could possibly happen would
have any terrors for me—that the worst must
surely be over.”</p>

<p>I listened in the greatest astonishment.
This was hardly the piteous supplicant I had
expected.</p>

<p>“Pray do not think that my sufferings have
resulted from the operations of a guilty conscience.
I have not reproached myself for
having taken advantage of humanity’s inalienable
right of self-defense. But I was only a
poor, weak woman after all, and the dread of
punishment at human hands, even though what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
I had done was justifiable before God, terrified
me.</p>

<p>“However, I lived through the ordeal of last
night, and prospective punishment has now no
longer any terrors for me. Face it I will, if
face it I must.</p>

<p>“I have not come to offer any arguments in
defense of any act I may have committed, nor
do I intend to beg for mercy at the hands of
the only person who, thus far, is in a position
to accuse me of a crime. Still less have I come
here for the purpose of telling you my story, for
there is really nothing to add to what you already
know or have surmised, and it would not be
fair to ask me to review the events the culmination
of which you witnessed night before last.
My soul has been harrowed enough. It has received
its baptism of fire. I have come merely
to say to you that I do not wish you to compound
any felonies with your own conscience,
or risk your reputation—or perhaps even your
liberty—by protecting one who is an absolute
stranger to you, and not entitled to the slightest
consideration on your part.</p>

<p>“If, knowing the circumstances—and you
must know them, after attending Mr. Peyton
professionally and having read a certain letter—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
believe it to be your duty to turn my
case over to the proper authorities, I am willing
to have you do so, and shall abide by the
consequences. I do not say this as one who
has no longer anything to live for, but as one
who has become reconciled to whatever fate
has in store for her.</p>

<p>“It may be incomprehensible to you, doctor,
but life and liberty are especially sweet to me—much
sweeter to-day, than they were prior—well,
just prior to the events of the day before
yesterday. I am capable of forgetting the
past and enjoying such happiness as the future
may have in store for me. For this much, and
for the circumstances which led to our acquaintance,
I am indebted to the hot Latin
blood with which my father endowed me. Last
night, the colder elements of my heredity held
full sway and I was afraid. To-day, sir, I am
a Morales. Had you known my father you
would understand what that means.</p>

<p>“Doctor, it is for you to do as your conscience
dictates. If you decide that it is your duty to
relegate a certain matter to the authorities for
investigation I shall not blame you. Furthermore,
I shall not attempt to escape, as was my
first impulse when you left me yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
afternoon. To merely escape punishment would
not be enough; I must remain free from suspicion,
or life means nothing to me, absolutely
nothing!”</p>

<p>The young woman rose from her chair and
stood in calm expectancy. Her attitude was
so entirely different from what I had anticipated
from the character of the letter which I
had in my possession, and from what was
evidently an exceedingly emotional temperament,
that I sat silently gazing at her for some
time. I finally rose to my feet and was about
to reply, when there came a sharp rap upon
the door of my consultation room. I opened
the door and found my attendant standing
there with a yellow paper in his extended hand.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” I asked, rather
impatiently.</p>

<p>“Pardon me for disturbing you, sir, but
there’s a man here from the undertaker’s,
with a certificate for you to sign, and he says
it is important, because the funeral is this
afternoon, sir?”</p>

<p>I took the ominous yellow form from the
man, closed the door and returned to my desk.
With the paper still in my hand I turned to
my fair visitor. She paled perceptibly, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
fancied, trembled a little, but returned my
gaze unflinchingly, although I was sure she
knew.</p>

<p>“Game to the core!” I thought.</p>

<p>I turned slowly to my desk, picked up a pen
and wrote—“Ptomaine poisoning—Acute Gastritis,”
then, without a twinge of conscience,
deliberately signed my name to the “yellow
peril” and rang for my attendant.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LOVE OF TIS-SA-ACK AND TU-TOCH-A-NU-LAH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Ah-wi-yah—the Beautiful,” she was once
justly called. And now that the weight of many,
many years bore heavily upon her, the warriors
of the tribe, recalling the traditions of the past,
still called her “The Beautiful.” But who
would ever think that the bent and withered old
squaw was once the pride of her tribe? The
scorching suns of many summers, and the keen,
chilling blasts of many cruel winters had indeed
made sad havoc in the beauty of Yosemite’s
queen.</p>

<p>No one knew how old Ah-wi-yah was—no one
knew when she first came to the valley of Yosemite.
There was none of all her people who
could recall the time when she was not already
very, very old and wrinkled. The most venerable
sagamore of the tribe remembered that the
old squaw was regarded as the only living relic
of an age of by-gone majesty, when he was yet
scarcely more than a small pappoose, boarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
and strapped with thongs to his mother’s back.
He recalled that it was she who smiled upon him,
and patted his head approvingly on the glorious
and never to be forgotten day when his
little hands and feeble arms first drew a slender,
feathered arrow to its barbed head, and from a
child’s bow sent it hurtling on its deadly flight
at a startled rabbit that traversed his path. He
remembered too, that the venerable Ah-wi-yah,
standing erect before her lodge with fiery, flashing
eyes, led the wild, fierce shout of triumph
when he, grown to the stature of a brave, came
home from the warpath with his first scalp.
And it was the old squaw who, with her own
wrinkled hands, hung the still bleeding trophy
on his lodge pole, and foretold that the ghastly,
gory emblem of his valor would have many,
many children.</p>

<p>Yes, Ah-wi-yah was very, very old—so old
that she recalled the time when the fair Po-ho-ho
waterfall was but a silvery, gleaming ribbon no
larger than a stalk of maize—so old that she remembered
the days when the Mission Fathers
had not yet come to the Land of the Golden
Sunset.</p>

<p>White as the snows of the Sierran winter was
the hair of Ah-wi-yah, but her eye—so wondrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
dark—was bright and piercing beneath
her shaggy, wrinkled brow, and her voice was
sweet and flute-like; clear as a wandering echo
amid the towering, craggy hills of the smiling
beautiful valley wherein her tribe had lived
and died for unnumbered ages.</p>

<p>Ah-wi-yah was often the counsellor of the
chieftains of the tribe for, squaw though she
was, she alone knew the records of the more
glorious and war-like past of her fast diminishing
kindred. The old squaw lived not in the
dull and spiritless present, though her aged
tongue was wise and crafty. She lived in the
glorious olden days, that wondrous, shadowy
past that held for her such memories of long
vanished greatness—and who knows what sweet
and tender romance?</p>

<p>When I, a curious tourist, wished to study
the wonderful traditions of the tribe, the warriors
said: “Oh pale face, there is none left to
tell thee of our glorious and deathless past but
Ah-wi-yah, the Beautiful. In the vast storehouse
of her unfailing memory there are many
marvellous and beautiful legends. Go to her—the
wise old squaw—she will tell them to thee,
we doubt not gladly.”</p>

<p>And the white haired squaw with the flute-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
voice told me many thrilling, beautiful legends
of the days when her tribe was strong and mighty—the
days when the Manitou never forgot his
chosen people, the children of the lustrous Sun.
Of all the legends that Ah-wi-yah told the wondering
pale face, there was none so beautiful as
the love of Tis-sa-ack and Tu-toch-a-nu-lah.
This I will relate just as the wonderful story-teller,
who has long since been gathered to her
fathers, and whose fragile bones are now mouldering
in a dark and gloomy canyon of the towering
Sierras, told it me.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“The memory of man, O Pale Face, goeth
not so far back into the distant past as the happy
days when the children of the glorious Sun first
built their blazing council fires in the beautiful,
mountain locked valley of the Yosemite. In
that unremembered time the baleful glitter of
the white sails of the accursed, marauding pale
face had not yet defiled the pure blue waters of
the broad Pacific. The Sierras were illumined
by the red glare of the watch-fires of a mighty,
heroic race of redmen, and the waters laughed
and sang in joyful cadence with the dancing of
their light canoes.</p>

<p>“And in those joyous days the Manitou smiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
upon his chosen people, for they were as yet
pure, and uncontaminated by the conflicting
creeds, multitudinous diseases, bad fire-water
and worse morals of the wicked white man. The
Indian was a fearless, noble warrior and a man,
roaming the trackless woods and traversing the
waters of his ancient ancestral home as free as
the wild birds of his native hills.</p>

<p>“In that far distant time happiness hovered
like a golden cloud over the lodges of the redman,
for within all was peace, and comfort, and plenty.
Neither cold nor hunger came like an evil spirit
to bring woe to the redman’s bosom. The
forests were alive with mighty game, and he
was a poor and lowly hunter indeed, who could
not show that acknowledged badge of fearless
courage, a necklace made of the cruel claws
of the fierce grizzly bear. The lakes and streams
were teeming with glittering fish, in number like
the falling leaves of the yellow autumn, many-hued
and brilliant as the rainbow.</p>

<p>“For him who fain would seek for glory, there
was many a gory scalp lock to be fairly and hazardously
earned in fierce, relentless battle, while
for the feeble, timid spirit who shrank from the
hardships and dangers of war, the warm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
fertile soil promised the husbandman rich rewards
of nutritious maize.</p>

<p>“On the green-verdured slopes and in the
broad, smiling valleys gleamed many a comfortable
wigwam of poles and dried skins of
wild beasts, wrought with the weird hieroglyphs
of the tribe—strange, ancient characters and
picture-writing, unintelligible even to the Indian
of to-day. The smoke of a thousand lodges
rose and mingled with the snowy vapor—the
fleeces of the sky—mingled with the billowy
flocks and herds of the Manitou.</p>

<p>“The valley of the sparkling Yosemite—that
wonderful stream of liquid silver whose
mystic source is in the clouds, far, far beyond
any trail of man—was the earthly paradise of
the redman of the mountains. To say that
the great ineffable Beyond—the land of Manitou
the Mighty—was fairer than the beauteous
valley of the Yosemite, was the utmost limit
of the Indian’s faith in heaven—those Happy
Hunting Grounds to which death alone could
transport him. Aye, it was the farthest limit
of the redman’s imagination.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“Chief among the sachems of his tribe, was
Tu-toch-a-nu-lah. Tall was he, like the towering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
redwood; strong were his limbs like those
of a mighty oak; rugged were his broad shoulders
as the frowning, beetling cliffs of the
mountain locked home of his people. There
was none so bold and so brave as he—the
mightiest hunter and most daring warrior of
all his tribe. Within his lodge there hung the
scalps of countless enemies, and the claws of
many a savage bear of the mountains. Brave?
Had he not slain by a single blow with his
keen hunting knife the terrible panther—alone
and single-handed had he not slain him? And
where was the lodge that was large enough to
hold the wide, branching horns of the kingly
elk he had brought panting to the earth with
his deadly, slender-shafted arrows? Straight
was his handsome form as the ashen spear-shaft,
and elastic as the bow of hickory; swifter
was his moccasined foot than the red deer’s;
lighter his step than the mountain lion’s;
bright was his piercing eye as the first beams
of the rising sun; keen was his vision as that
of the king of birds—the great war eagle.
There was not among all the Sun’s brave
children a chief so nobly grand as he.</p>

<p>“Far up on the side of a steep, wooded
mountain was the home lodge of Tu-toch-a-nu-lah.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Here, like an eagle in his cloud-kissed
eyrie, he watched over the welfare of his people
as became a wise and mighty sachem who loved
them and was well beloved by them.</p>

<p>“Beloved by them? Aye, and passing well,
for he was their loyal, ever-ready champion,
their benefactor and protector, and they—being
red, not white—were grateful.</p>

<p>“Ranging over the fertile upper plains, the
mighty sachem herded droves on droves of the
graceful red deer, that his people might choose
the best and fattest for the feast. High up
amid the rocks were his flocks of big-horned
mountain sheep—the picturesque and shaggy
cimarron. The savage bear he gave not peace,
for he drove him forth from his rocky lair that
the braves of the tribe might win laurels in
the hunt.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, when the skies had been unkind
and the Sun Father had scorched the delicate
leaves and fragrant blossoms and shrivelled
the tender stalks of the young maize for many
days, the wise and thoughtful sachem brought
forth the magic red pipe he had fashioned in
the far off land of the fierce Dacotahs. As he
silently sat and smoked the sweetly pungent
killikinnic, the billowy clouds of sweet incense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
were gently wafted to the sapphire skies and
kissed them, so tenderly and lovingly that they
wept for very joy. And those blissful tears
fell as a soothing, gentle rain upon the drooping
maize, and trees and flowers, until they raised
their fainting, almost dying heads in joy and
gladness. Then the vast choirs of brilliant-hued
singing birds awoke once more the musical
echoes of the sighing forest, and sweetly sang
the praises, of the mighty Tu-toch-a-nu-lah,
bravest and most tender-hearted of his race—greatest
of all the proud and haughty Yosemite.</p>

<p>“When the drought was over and the parched
and thirsty soil was once more moist, the
fragrant smoke billows of the magic pipe floated
blithely, airily up to the fiercely glaring sun and
brought down millions of warm, yet softened
rays through the clear blue air that soon ripened
the luxuriant crops into gold—gold that the
joyful women should gather with singing and
merry making in the harvest-time to be.</p>

<p>“When the mighty sachem was happy, and
laughed, the Yosemite danced and sparkled in
the sunlight as though rejoicing with him, its
winding way rippling into pleasant, cheery
smiles. When he sighed, the soughing wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
wailed mournfully through the cone-laden boughs
of the tall bread pines, or howled dismally
down the dark and gloomy canyons like the
spirit of some tortured brave. When he spake,
his voice was sometimes like the soft, gentle
cooing of the ring-dove, at others like the deep,
sonorous voice of the cataract. But when he
raging smote to death the giant grizzly, or
fiercely tore the scalp lock from the skull of an
enemy, his fearful war whoop rang out among
the crags and gorges of the Sierras like the
loud mutterings of the thunder, aye, like the
awful rumbling and crashing of the earthquake.</p>

<p>“None there was in his tribe so learned as
Tu-toch-a-nu-lah, for the smoke of his pipe
oft brought him wonderful visions that the eye
of none other ever saw. Through the blue,
odorous haze of the burning killikinnic the
Manitou had many a time spoken words of
wisdom to his favorite child.</p>

<p>“And the noble sachem had travelled much.
The soft tread of his moccasined feet had been
felt by all the land from Oregon to the gulf,
north and south, and from the Father of Waters
to the blue Pacific, east and west. The broad
prints of his snow shoes were upon the eternal
snows of every land in the ice bound north.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
He had been in the far off Northland where, on
a throne of glittering ice, robed in a mantle of
ermine frost, sits the Queen of the Heavens.
And he had seen crouching at her feet the great
White Rabbit—with his own eyes had he seen
it. There he had walked through the valley of
peace and plenty, in the land where the year
is but a night and a day. He had passed
reverently among the graves of his ancestors,
who lay there sleeping beneath the green
mantle that the eternal snows could not chill.
He had communed with that sleeping race of
giant redmen and had heard them whisper of
the day when time shall be no more, when the
enemies of his race shall have passed and those
mighty warriors shall arise to claim their long
lost birthright.</p>

<p>“And Tu-toch-a-nu-lah knew the message of
the north wind as it whistled among the mountains.
To him spake the giant redwoods, as
they battled with the gales of winter. And
they spake of battles won in other days, for
within those forest monarchs were imprisoned
the souls of his forefathers, those red kings
of aforetime. To him sang the robin in the
springtime, and he heard and understood the
twitter of the snowbird, in the days when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Winter had laid his frosty fingers upon the
verdant valley. For him the pines and cedars
gave forth their balmy breath and fragrant
balsam. He was Nature’s best beloved child
and his mother was kind to the sachem.</p>

<p>“He it was who taught the boys of his tribe
to catch the fish with hooks of bone in summer,
and to kill them with the spear through the icy
coverings of the streams in winter. ’Twas
he who taught them how to make the bow and
the barbed and feathered ashen shafts that
should slay the grizzly and their foes among
the redmen. And when the bows and shafts
were done ’twas Tu-toch-a-nu-lah who led
them into the sombre, fragrant woods and
taught them to stalk and slay the deer. He
was the children’s best friend and wisest counsellor.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was a brave and mighty warrior,
and a wise one.</p>

<p>“Tender hearted and loving though he was,
the great heart of Tu-toch-a-nu-lah had never
been touched, be it ever so lightly, by love of
woman. Strong and tireless in the chase,
brave in battle, wiser than the wisest at the
council fires of his people, kind and loving
to all, the mighty warrior knew not yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
burning, all consuming glow of the most sacred
fire that burns on human altars—he knew not
the fire of passion. Of all the dark-eyed
maidens and comely squaws of his tribe, there
was none whose bright and longing eyes had
ever aroused in his bosom the glorious and
all-responsive thrill that might have bid her
hope. Gaze upon him as yearningly and
tenderly as she might, there was not one who
could say that she was the woman whom fate
had set apart for him.</p>

<p>“No, the handsome sachem had never known
the love of woman—and yet the star of human
destiny was ever hovering over his beloved
head, and was soon to illumine with its fiery
darts the utmost depth of the still, dark waters
of romance that lay hidden within his soul.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“There had been a long and parching drought,
and the delicate leaves and blossoms, and the
tender heads of the young growing maize were
drooping in weakness and sorrow, when from
his lofty mountain lodge came forth Tu-toch-a-nu-lah.
In his hand he held the magic calumet.
Seating himself on a rocky height whence
he could smile down upon his faithful people,
he smoked, and blew the perfumed clouds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
toward heaven. It was early in the morning,
and the red-glowing Sun Father was just rising
from behind the mountains, his thirsty beams
greedily drinking the lovely diamond-like dew-drops
that tremblingly hung upon the verdure
of the valley.</p>

<p>“At the further end of the valley was a mighty
gray dome of time-worn granite, smooth and
round as though made and polished by human
hands. As the circling smoke rings rose from
the sachem’s calumet, the gentle breeze bore
them slowly to the southward, where they lingered
in fantastic wreaths about the dome. The
sun gilded with its brilliant beams the rocky
summit and pierced the hovering clouds of perfumed
pipe smoke as with golden arrows. The
dome was surrounded as it were with a splendid
halo, such as the chieftain had never before seen.
As he gazed, the sky above the dome was illumined
as by a gigantic, surpassingly beautiful
rainbow.</p>

<p>“The smoke now faded away and there in a
blaze of golden glory sat a maiden! Beautiful
was she, beyond all the women Tu-toch-a-nu-lah
had ever seen. She was not like the dusky,
dark-eyed, raven-haired maidens of his tribe,
for her skin was like the warm and radiant glow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
of the fiery setting sun on the calm still waters of
the blue Pacific. Red were her cheeks like the
roses of the valley. Her hair, like the ripened
maize in autumn, fell over her white shoulders
and about her lovely form as falls the sparkling
spray of the beautiful cataract—the Bridal Veil,
Po-ho-no—like golden water rippling over rocks
of silver. Shining fair was her brow as though
illumined by the pale, soft beauty of moonlight,
and deep and dark was the liquid blue of her
eyes, like the shaded pools of the verdant valley,
far, far below. Small and shining was her
foot, like a tuft of feathery snow twinkling
through the boughs of the pines and firs in winter—like
the spring of a fairy bow was its graceful
arch. Over her dimpled, ivory shoulders
fluttered two delicate wings of rose-like cloud.
As his eyes fell upon her she called to him.
Sweet and sad was her voice as the call of the
night bird of the forest.</p>

<p>“The Sachem sprang to his feet and stood and
gazed in speechless wonder. The precious red
calumet fell unheeded to the ground, whence it
bounded off the rocky ledge and went clattering
down to a fragmentary fate on the cruel jagged
rocks below.</p>

<p>“The beautiful maiden smiled upon him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
whispered softly as she held out her arms lovingly,
entreatingly toward him. ‘I, thy Tis-sa-ack,
am here. Oh, Tu-toch-a-nu-lah, come’—then
gliding swiftly up the smooth and dangerous
rocky dome, she vanished over its rounded top.</p>

<p>“As springs the startled deer from his leafy
covert in the woods, so, with heart aflame, sprang
Tu-toch-a-nu-lah in pursuit of the lovely maiden.
Swift and sure of foot was he like the panther
of the mountains, alert was he of ear like
the wolf of the prairie, keen was his eye as that
of the eagle, yet hopeless was his pursuit. The
soft and beautiful down from her snowy wings
was wafted back, veiling her from his enamored
eyes and enveloping him in a feathery cloud
denser than the mist of the morning. When
the mountain breeze had borne the obscuring
cloud away and he could once more see, the
maiden had disappeared. There was naught
upon the dome but a rosy haze that was fast
dissolving before the merciless rays of the Sun
Father. Far below him he saw the smoke of
the cheerful camp fires of his people—the people
who loved him and whom he loved. But he
turned again and gazed longingly at the rocky
dome.</p>

<p>“So fell the wise and mighty chieftain before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
the arrows of all conquering Love. He at last
was as other men—touched by the divine
fire.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>“The ardent passion of new found love leaves
room for no other sentiment, and his people soon
found Th-toch-a-nu-lah sadly changed. He
went no more upon the hunt or fierce foray; the
savage bear no longer cowered and trembled at
the dread sound of his footstep amid the mountains;
his enemies blanched not, nor quaked
with fear at the thunder of his voice. The
sachem was no longer the wise counsellor and
devoted ruler; he was like a new and strange
being, and his neglected people marvelled much,
and beheld the change with sorrow.</p>

<p>“Every morning was Tu-toch-a-nu-lah to be
found eagerly wending his way to the rocky
dome where he first saw the lovely Tis-sa-ack.
He laid love offerings of wild flowers and the
fruit of the bread pine upon the rocky dome, and
awaited her coming with all the ardor of one
upon whose heart love has but newly smiled.
But only when he was far distant from the dome
on which she sat enthroned would the beautiful
maiden appear before his dazzled vision.</p>

<p>“Pursue her as quickly as he might, he caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
her not. He heard but the faint and far-away
sound of her footsteps, gentle as the falling of
an autumn leaf, and the soft rustle of her wings
as the unpitying wind blew their snowy, bewildering
down into his longing eyes. He
might devour with passionate glances her beautiful,
shining form; he might in thought revel in
her glory of golden hair; he might even look from
afar into the limpid depths of her gentle blue
eyes, yet was he never to clasp his loved one to
his bosom. Struck dumb by her wondrous
beauty, never did he speak before her, and
never again did her sweet-toned voice fall like
the tinkle of rippling brooks upon his enamored
ear.</p>

<p>“And with the full blossoming of the flower
of love in the heart of the sagamore came neglect
of duty. His all absorbing passion swallowed
up all regard for the welfare of his people—all
remembrance of the beautiful valley for
which he had ever so tenderly cared. The
world was lost and found in Tis-sa-ack. So
all consuming was his passion for her, so constant
his thoughts of her, that the crops of
Yosemite were neglected—aye, forgotten, and
they, being without rain and deprived of his
tender care, drooped their delicate heads mournfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
and shrank away and died. The breezes
whistled and sighed sadly through the juiceless
blades of the wild corn that rustled in shrivelled
dry response that had naught of life in it. The
grass and leaves lost their freshness and turned
autumnal brown—sure harbinger of death. The
flowers lost their freshness and beauty and their
petals fell to the dry earth, one by one, while
the bee no longer stored sweet honey in the
hollow trees.</p>

<p>“Dazzled were the eyes of Tu-toch-a-nu-lah
by the shining wings, golden hair and ivory
throat of the beautiful maiden, and he saw none
of this. Love had blinded him to all save its
object.</p>

<p>“But the fair Tis-sa-ack looked down upon
the unhappy neglected valley with eyes of sorrow,
as she stood in the early morning upon the
mighty dome. As she gazed she wept with
compassion, and kneeling down on the smooth,
unfeeling rock she besought the Great Spirit to
be merciful unto the beautiful valley of Yosemite
and bring forth again the beautiful flowers
and green trees and shrubs, the delicate grasses,
nodding firs and waving maize.</p>

<p>“Then, with an awful crash as of thunder, beneath
her feet the great dome was riven asunder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
and the melting snows of the Nevada gushed
through the wonderful gorge as if by magic!
A lovely lake formed between the steep walls
of living rock, and a gently murmuring river
started therefrom on its meandering, life-giving
course through the parched and thirsty valley.</p>

<p>“And then came a wonderful transformation.
The valley was infused with new life. The
flowers and trees, the withered grass and the
yellowing maize raised their dying heads and
smiled with joy as the stream of life crept silently
through the parched soil at their shrunken
roots. The breeze was laden with the perfumed
thanks of the blossoms; the freshened
blades of the wild corn rustled and shivered
with pleasure as the moisture laden air softly
caressed them. The mighty trees were thrilled
with delight as the sap, with velvet footfall,
ran up their trunks, bringing life and energy
and renewed vigor. All was peace and happiness
again, and the valley of the Yosemite
was once more verdant and beautiful.</p>

<p>“But the mysterious maiden, for whom the
valley had so sadly suffered—she who had so
successfully appealed to the Manitou—was seen
no more. As she flew swiftly as flies the swallow,
away toward the western skies, there to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
fade from the sachem’s sight forever, myriads
of delicate downy tufts were wafted from her
lovely wings. They fell upon the margin of
the new and beautiful lake, and where they fell
may to-day be seen thousands on thousands
of fragrant little white violets.</p>

<p>“And Tu-toch-a-nu-lah is still wandering
sadly about the world seeking her whom he
loved and lost. Ere he left his ancestral home,
to return no more, that the noble race of Yosemite
might never forget him he carved the
outlines of his god-like head upon the haughty
rock that bears his name. There it will forever
stand, steadfastly gazing toward the dome
whereon he found and lost Tis-sa-ack, the beloved—the
first and last love of his noble heart.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, when the fragrant morning breeze
sweeps gently round and round the rocky dome,
the maidens of the Yosemite whisper one to
another, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Hark! Tis-sa-ack the loved and lost one,
is calling the brave Tu-toch-a-nu-lah.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Over the entrance of what was once the Iroquois
Theater, hangs a head, which the sculptor
probably intended for the Goddess of Music. As
I gaze upon the head its outlines become first
blurred and then transformed. A Death’s head
stands out in bold relief! The noble image of
the Indian Chieftain that was once there, has
been consigned to the Limbo of the Forgotten—to
the Valley of Dead Lumber. The Death’s
head grins and grins—grins sardonically. One
can almost hear a chuckle, as the horrid thing
looks down upon the heedless, hurrying crowd
in the busy street. Seeing the thing above the
door as I passed by in the midst of the throng
to-day, I wondered why it grinned,—why it did
not weep. Did it grin because it knew how
soulless were the human things that inspired
the hand which carved it; because it and the
men who placed it there were of the same brotherhood
of ghouls; because it felt that it was a
grim satire upon humanity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
Have men whose hearts are adamant, whose
souls are sordid, the right to stamp their own
shamelessness upon a helpless block of stone;
the right to hang it where it must perforce reflect
their own cold, calculating, emotion defying
inner consciousness upon the man in the
street?</p>

<p>Beneath the grinning head, and flanking it
below on either side, are impudently assertive,
glaring legends that proclaim in lurid blatant
type—“The Iroquois is no more.” The new
temple of Thespis which, Phœnix like, has
risen from the ashes of the old, is a “Music
Hall.”</p>

<p>More harshly grating than all is the legend
which announces that the new place of amusement
will open to-night. Thus have insensate
paint, paper and ink become accessories to a
crime.</p>

<p>Yes, to-night the theater re-opens. “Refined
Vaudeville” with a “Galaxy of Stars,” the bill
boards say. And as the players caper about
and sing, dance and perpetrate their quips and
jokes, will they not see? They will gaze out
upon the audience that applauds, and how can
they fail to see the wraiths of that other audience?
They will all be there, those ghostly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
ones. Sitting bolt upright where they died,
piled row upon row in the aisles, massed in bewildering
tangles at the doors—those delusive
doors that would not open—they will all be
there. And will <em>they</em> applaud, think you?</p>

<p>In this commercial age there is little room
for sentiment. A people that will permit the
fair face of Nature to be disfigured by the
painter of patent medicine ads; that will gaze
calmly upon a pictured ham or the announcement
of the birth of a new “liver-pad” on the
Palisades; that will tolerate on our boulevards
flaming advertisements of the latest thing in
corsets or “union suits,” is not likely to protest
against a Death’s head that merely grins over
the gate of a charnel house. And yet the
people know. They have read of the awful
things that lie behind that awful grin. Many
of them have suffered, still more have seen.
A few, a very few, go by on the other side of
the street with suffused eyes averted, and
great sobs of agony welling up in their throats.</p>

<p>“An’ I should live a thousand years,” I
could not forget. Many horrible sights had I
seen; much suffering had I witnessed; the faces
of the dead had long since ceased to be a novelty
to me and were no longer awesome;—I fancied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
I had grown callous. But that awful fire!
Would that I could blunt the memory of it.
Would that I might shelve it as but another
experience in the land of Work-a-day.</p>

<p>As I looked upon the Death’s head, it seemed
to single me out from the crowd, leering at me
triumphantly. Did it note my emotion and
gloat over it?</p>

<p>I raged inwardly and was tempted to—But,
had I seized a paving stone and smashed that
vile image to bits, I could not have made them
understand. Least of all could I have compelled
the understanding of that huge policeman,
who stood idly by, swinging his club in
a way that suggested danger to sentimental
cranks. When that team of horses swung
around the corner, narrowly missing a woman
who, bundles in arms and children at her side,
was frantically trying to cross the street, the
officer was gazing at a figure of Gambrinus in
the saloon window across the way. He had
appetites, but no sentiment, that man in blue.</p>

<p>Standing there in the street, jostled and
elbowed by the surging crowd that had no time
for dreaming, there rose before me a picture
which the Death’s head also saw;—its expression
showed that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
When on that fateful afternoon the call came
for physicians to succor the hapless victims of
that pitiless massacre of the innocents, there
was no hesitancy upon the part of all who were
within call. They hastened to respond, and
stood not upon the order of their going. Humanity
cried for aid—that was enough. When
I arrived at the scene, only a few moments
after the occurrence of the frightful disaster,
the firemen had just forced their way into the
foyer. The air within had begun to be barely
breathable. Noticing several firemen groping
their way up one of the marble stairways, I
followed them. The air was so full of pungent
smoke that objects were with great difficulty
to be made out. At the top of the stairs, on
the landing just outside the only door that was
open in the front of the theater, the firemen
met with an obstruction—a solid, monstrous
cube of human bodies, as high as one could
reach. This ghastly mass of bodies was free
upon two sides—at the upper steps of the main
stair and at the top of several steps leading to
a main balcony within the foyer. On the other
side the mass was hemmed in by the wall of the
stairway. Behind it were piled the bodies of
other human beings who had tried to climb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
over those in front and had failed. These last
extended from the choked up door almost to
the lower balcony rail within the theater.
There was another door, but this was closed
tight, and staunchly held by a strong lock and
a heavy something behind it.</p>

<p>Seeing this wall of bodies I stopped short;—I
confess it. The awful shock of it all came
over me. For a moment I felt my knees give
way beneath me. I grew faint and sick,—and
then started back the way I had come. Half
way down the stairs I stopped, and pulling
myself together went back to duty. And then
I stayed, like a soldier who runs away at the
first volley of shot, but comes back and fights
to the end.</p>

<p>The firemen were pulling at the mass of
bodies, vainly trying to dislodge them. Several
of the men climbed on top of the awful pile
and tried to disentangle the bodies, bruising
and crushing the while the upturned faces and
helpless limbs with their cruel boots.</p>

<p>Alas! The mass of bodies was not to be
untangled until too late, far too late. And yet,
the pile was free upon two sides, and it looked
easy enough to extricate those who were there.
And so we tugged, and strained, and pulled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
and pried at them. “My God!” I thought.
“If we can only break the dead-lock and get
them started!”</p>

<p>“Break the dead-lock?” Well, perhaps we
might have done so if we had worked longer
and more systematically. But the firemen
said, “It’s no use.”</p>

<p>A big policeman who stood idly by, too
dignified to help in the work of rescue, said to
me, “Gwan out o’ that!”</p>

<p>“But,” I answered, “I’m a doctor. Some of
these people <em>must</em> be alive. I can’t go away
without trying to get a body out. If I get
only one out we may break the lock.”</p>

<p>And again he said, “Gwan out o’ that, or
I’ll—” and he brandished his club menacingly.</p>

<p>And so I went “out o’ that.” I climbed
over the bannister and on to the balcony and
attacked the bodies from the other side, unnoticed
by the officer and free from interference
by the firemen, who had all gone, save two or
three whose feet were still grinding and crushing
the inanimate forms on the top of the pile.</p>

<p>Again I tugged and pulled at the bodies,
this time with better success. Down in
one corner of the mass, protected somewhat
by the marble pillar forming the arch which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
connected the landing with the balcony, lay
a little boy of perhaps ten years of age. I drew
him out quite easily. He still breathed. Next
to him lay the body of a grey haired woman.
Her face was gashed across by a blow from
the boot of some one caught in the death
struggles of that pile. As I dragged her body
from beneath the towering mass of death, an
opera glass, innocent accessory to murder, fell
from her nerveless hand and clattered upon the
marble floor of the balcony. She, too, was
alive.</p>

<p>Curiosity seekers had by this time entered
the building. I impressed several of them into
service, and between us we carried the bodies
of the old woman and the boy down the stair
by which they had climbed to their deaths, to
the street, and into the restaurant next-door,
which was rapidly becoming transformed into
a morgue and hospital emergency ward. Leaving
the poor creatures to the care of some of
my brother physicians, I rushed back to that
pile of bodies—to again attempt to break that
awful dead-lock.</p>

<p>As I re-entered the door of the theater I
heard a man wildly expostulating with several
policemen. He madly insisted on entering, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
they as strenuously refused to allow him to do
so. His voice seemed familiar, and I turned
to look. He sprang past the opposing arms
of the officers, grasped me by the shoulders
and cried, “My God! man, can’t you help me?
My daughters are in there somewhere!” He
was one of my oldest and dearest friends. I
had watched his children grow up from babyhood
to childhood, from childhood to womanhood
and loved them.</p>

<p>“Surely,” I said, “you are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I am sure!” he cried, in agony.
“Help me to find them, oh, help me to find
them!”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” I replied, as I sprang up
the stairs. Pointing to the pile of bodies on
the landing, I said, “If they were in the theater
at all, let us hope that they have either escaped
or are here in this pile. Help me, Harry, let
us try to get these bodies free.”</p>

<p>Imprisoned in the mass of bodies, hanging
several feet above the floor, caught only by the
lower limbs, with the head, trunk and arms
perfectly free, was the body of a powerful man.
Surely this one could be removed. My friend,
one of the strongest men I know, assisted me,
and we pulled at the body until—well, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
my poor friend weakened and fled. And then
two other sturdy men came to my aid, and we
tugged at the body until a policeman drove us
away. And my dear friend’s children were in
that heap of dead all the while!</p>

<p>Not until the theater proper was entered,
and the bodies that were heaped up behind
them removed, did it become possible to remove
the dead upon the landing. Oh, the pity of it!
There they lay, apparently outside the zone of
danger and death. And the hands that would
fain have saved them were impotent. Untangle
them? Think of a lot of huge angle-worms
massed together; give those angle-worms
legs and arms to twist and intertwine, hands to
grip in the death throes, and heads to interlock,
and you may understand. And yet, perhaps not,—I
myself could not understand, nor believe,
had I not seen.</p>

<p>Looking back upon that awful scene of desolation
I can find but one crumb of comfort—only
one consolation. At the time I felt that many
in that pile of human forms must surely be
alive and could be saved, if only they could be
extricated. Oh, the horror of the idea! It
overwhelmed me then. But now as my mind
reverts to that scene of death, I am sure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
very few could have been alive, surer still that
none were conscious. I recall that not a sound
came from those lost ones. Not a cry for help,
not a moan of distress, not even a sigh to indicate
that life was still there. Oh, the awful stillness
of it all! The stillness of the dead lying
on the dripping slabs of a morgue. The stillness
of the subjects lying upon the tables of the
dissecting room. Even the man whose trunk
and head were free gave forth no sound. He
was caught only up to his hips. Had he been
alive, surely he would have made some sign.
He was not crushed, save perhaps as to his lower
limbs, and that could not have been mortal.
The weight of bodies does not crush limbs as
does machinery. No, he certainly must have
been dead.</p>

<p>And why did all these people fall upon the
landing? Of what did they die?</p>

<p>Plunging in the dark, pell mell through that
one narrow door, the poor creatures stumbled
down several steps that led from the door to the
landing. Cunningly devised trap this—wise
architect that designed it. Those who went
down, rose not again. They lay crushed by
the weight of the tangled up scores of other
hapless ones who followed after. A small part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
of the crowd, those who were not caught in the
tangle, flowed, as it were, over the top. A few,
just a very few, thus escaped.</p>

<p>As the helpless creatures lay there in that
fearful jam, at the only available exit in the
front of the house, the smoke, and flame, and
noxious gases were drawn irresistibly to that
same door. They too, sought an exit at the
front, and found only that death trap. The
draught must have been fierce, the flames like
a breath from hell. While the still breathing,
palpitating mass of crushed and bruised humanity
lay there imprisoned, the smoke and gases
were sucked through the door into the foyer,
diffusing themselves through the writhing human
hecatomb, and giving those not yet dead a
painless <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de grace</i>. How soon it must have
been over! How useless the emotions that
shook my very soul as I gazed upon the slaughtered
ones. And how solacing the conclusions
with which calm retrospection has replaced the
horrible immediate impressions of the scene
itself.</p>

<p>Merciful indeed, the smoke and those noxious
gases, especially for those luckless ones
who lay on the top of the pile of victims. These
were scorched and burned—not badly, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
enough to show that with the death-dealing
smoke and gases the flames came also. A fearful
gust or two—perhaps only one, and the work
was done.</p>

<p>And the scene at the open door of death was
but a fragment of the frightful holocaust.
Death’s barbecue lay behind that heap of
bodies. Towering up behind that other front
door which would not open, were scores of
blackened bodies, some burned and distorted out
of all semblance to their living form. Still
others sat upright where Death had surprised
them. They died in their seats without resistance,
overcome doubtless, by the deadly gases.</p>

<p>There, standing erect, like soldiers, packed
like sardines, on a stair case behind a locked
iron gate, was row on row of dead, who had lost
their lives trying to escape from the gallery to
join the panic-stricken ones in the lower balcony.
Hopeless effort—what matter where they
died? As well meet death face to face, there
upon that inner stair behind that merciless trap
gate, as in that pile upon the landing—perhaps
better, who knows?</p>

<p>Over yonder is an “exit,” one of many similar
delusions. This one leads into a blind hallway.
Here again, stand the dead bodies of unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
beings who died fighting for life against
invincible odds.</p>

<p>Scattered about in the aisles between the balcony
rail and the death trap “exits”—oh, the
mockery of the word!—lay bodies burned to a
cinder. Among them lay the body of a noble
youth, the son of one of my friends, whose life
was so full of promise, so replete with possible
future usefulness, so suggestive of future greatness
even, that I do not wonder the father was
crushed to the earth. I loved the lad, and if,
deep down, my friend’s grief were tinged with
resentment against the ordering of things, I
could understand and sympathize.</p>

<p>What foolishness have I attempted here?
Describe that scene within the Iroquois? Never
was quill wrought, that could do the subject
justice! Do you, those curious ones, who idly
stood in crowds about the building, watching the
poor victims who sprang from the windows in
the upper galleries or attempted to pass on a
frail ladder to the building across the alley, only
to be hurled to the ground and mangled to
death or permanent disability, think you could
picture it? If so, your storm centers of emotion
have no more potential energy than a babbling
brook—no more dynamic capacity than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
breeze that ripples a mill pond. Do you, my
friend, who stood with gaping mouth, watching
the charred, blackened forms brought forth from
the maw of hell by the firemen, think you could
depict the fearful sight? If so, I can only say:
“You did not see.”</p>

<p>Within the restaurant, the doctors worked
like beavers. They did not always work systematically—that
was impossible, in that confused
mass of people. Confusion? Ye Gods! Was
there ever such another scene? Distracted
friends and relatives in search of their loved
ones, nurses, doctors, firemen, policemen, and
others who were trying to lend a helping hand,
all contributed to the seething crowd of excited
humanity that packed the place. Then there
were the vulgar, bestial ones who stood and
gaped sensually at the nudity of the fire victims
who were being partially stripped by the
doctors in their efforts to save. Yes, such were
there, and they were numerous enough to make
one blush for humanity. These cursed blots
upon the face of nature, these moral monstrosities,
and the other morbidly curious beings
were alike obstructive. The first might not
be killed without process of law, and there was
so much to do that time could not be spared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
to throw the latter out upon the street. Once
I very nearly forgot my surroundings. I asked
a man who stood near to help me lift some dead
bodies from a table to the floor, to make room
for others in which there might still be life.
He refused and moved away, saying, “You
can do your own dirty work.” It was then
I so nearly forgot, and said sundry sulphurous
things. Had there been time, perhaps I should
have entirely forgotten. But I fancy the cur
was frightened, for after our brief and forceful
interview he started for the door and I did not
see him again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the midst of the closely packed
throng the stalwart firemen and policemen
pushed their way as best they could, bearing
the bodies of the dead. The work of rescue
was going on very slowly. Even the doctors
were not using their skill to the best advantage.
In some instances a veritable throng of them
were working, or attempting to work, simultaneously
upon one body. A clear headed
layman grasped the situation and, with the
assistance of some of the physicians, evolved
order out of chaos. Three doctors were assigned
to each table; the police cleared out many of
the drones in the crowd, and things began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
move more swiftly. The police in general did
excellent work. A glaring exception was a
certain well-known captain. Noticing his insignia
of office, I asked him to clear away the
people who were obstructing the passage of the
men who were carrying in the bodies. He
replied, “I’ve got no time for you. Hunt up
the man who has charge of the police detail.”
And then the heartless brute went on gaping
and getting in the way along with the rest of
the morbidly curious.</p>

<p>I wonder if many realize what it means to see
dead bodies so numerous that they might be
estimated by the cord. Those who do, may
perhaps picture to themselves the harrowing
scenes about those tables where the physicians
worked. As soon as a body was pronounced
dead, it was hurriedly laid aside to make room
for a possibly hopeful case. Cases in which
resuscitation was accomplished were carried
to the waiting ambulances and taken to the
hospitals. But, alas! these cases were few.</p>

<p>The bodies were brought to us in a seemingly
endless stream. As body after body was pronounced
lifeless and laid aside, the piles of
dead upon the tables grew higher and higher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
grew until, as I have said, they could only be
compared to piles of cord wood.</p>

<p>And what a difference in those bodies! Some
were so seared, so blistered and blackened
from the fire and smoke, that in the handling
of them the skin, and even the flesh, came off
in one’s hands in great shreds and rolls. A far
greater number were so free from mar or
discoloration, and their faces were so calm and
peaceful that it was hard to believe them dead.
Indeed, it was difficult to believe even that
animation was suspended. They apparently
had just fallen asleep.</p>

<p>And these last were to me the most awful
sight of all. The others—well, they were
better dead than living disfigured and maimed,
and besides, there had at no time been hope for
them. But these, ah, these! If only they had
not lain so long. A little stimulant for the
heart, a few compressions and relaxations of
the chest, and the life giving oxygen would have
entered their lungs and blood. They would
have been saved.</p>

<p>What pathetic incidents there were in that
restaurant.</p>

<p>A doctor friend of mine, a big hearted, broad
shouldered Nature’s nobleman, was pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
his way here and there through the crowd. I
noted him towering above those about him as
he jostled the people about, and called to him,
“Will you take a table?” But he did not
answer. He did not seem to see or hear. He
went on through the crowd from table to table
and finally disappeared. I marvelled then,
for I did not know. Poor fellow, his two
daughters, beautiful young women, had gone
to the Iroquois that day. He was looking, and
looking,—for that which was bound to crush
him, and hoping,—ah! hoping against hope, as
the sequence proved. His light had gone out—and
it has stayed out.</p>

<p>And I have just an inkling of what it all
meant to the bereaved ones. I had not yet had
time to ascertain whether my own wife and
children had chanced to go to the Iroquois that
afternoon. I recalled however, that I had
taken them to see the same play a few days before,
and concluded that they were not likely
to attend it again soon, but <span class="locked">still—</span></p>

<p>The horrible doubt had just begun to befog
my mind, when a new subject was laid upon
the table where I was working. It was the body
of a young girl. As I took the first hasty glance
at this latest unfortunate, I was almost stunned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
The resemblance to my younger daughter was
so startling that I was all but sure it was she.
It was but a fleeting moment before I knew,
but that ephemeral space of time was enough.
And then I understood, oh, so well.</p>

<p>“A father’s heart should not be deceived, even
for a moment,” I fancy I hear some one say.
Perhaps not, yet there was one unhappy man
in that frantic throng of those who were seeking
their beloved ones, whom I beheld, thrice in
succession, identifying a strange child as his
own. And that father had a heart of hearts,
as I have occasion to know.</p>

<p>Lying beneath one of the tables lay the body
of a beautiful little girl of about twelve years
of age. Fair was she, with golden hair and
cheeks still red. A doctor saw her lying there
and paused, wondering to himself whether his
brethren had worked quite long enough. She
surely did not look as if she were dead.</p>

<p>As the doctor stood wondering thus, a group
of young lads approached him from the other
side of the table. One of them cried appealingly:</p>

<p>“Oh, doctor, won’t you please try once more
to save that little girl. We know her, and know
her folks, and it will kill them if she dies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Another physician who was passing by, overhearing
said, “No use, old man. We worked
over her for forty minutes before we gave her
up,” and he hurried on to another table.</p>

<p>“Oh, but doctor,” said one of the boys appealingly,
“I just saw her eyes quiver.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said another, “and one of her fingers
just moved.”</p>

<p>“Dear, optimistic little liars,” said the doctor
afterward, “I just couldn’t stand it. I pulled
the body off the pile on which it lay, put it on
the table, and worked like a horse over it for
thirty minutes. And when the poor little chest
made a few pitifully gasping sounds under my
efforts, the expression of joy and hope on the
faces of those lads was wonderful to see.</p>

<p>“And when through sheer fatigue I at last
gave up the self imposed task that I knew was
hopeless at the beginning, one of the boys approached
me and tearfully whispered, ‘Please,
doctor, won’t you tell me your name? We want
to see that you get paid for trying to save our
little friend. You did just the best you could.’</p>

<p>“And,” said the doctor, “I couldn’t answer
him as I would have done had he been grown up.
The poor boy would not have understood. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
just choked up and sputtered, ‘See you again,
by and by, my boy, I’m in a hurry now.’</p>

<p>“Just think,” concluded the doctor, “here
was a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rara avis</i>—a dead person’s friend who
thought a doctor should be rewarded for doing
the best he could.”</p>

<p>And when I heard the story I said, “Old fellow,
that boy’s sentiments were awfully out of
place, but who shall say that they were out of
tune?”</p>

<p>There are many book-made heroes, but few
of real flesh and blood. There was one among
the injured ones who were brought in unconscious
and laid upon the tables at that restaurant.
He was a boy of some twelve or fourteen
years of age. He remained unconscious for
fully half an hour. Just as the doctors were
about to give him up as hopeless, he began to
revive, and was soon out of danger. Several
policemen approached him.</p>

<p>“What’s your name, sonny?” asked one of
the officers.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell you my name,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you <em>must</em> tell me your name.”</p>

<p>“But I won’t do it, so there now,” and the boy
set his teeth defiantly.</p>

<p>Curious to know why the boy objected to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
telling who he was, I motioned the officers
aside and asked quietly,</p>

<p>“Why don’t you give the policemen your
name, my boy?”</p>

<p>“’Cause,” replied the boy, “if I do, my pa and
my ma’ll hear about my bein’ hurt an’ it’ll
scare ’em most to death.”</p>

<p>And the boy would not be cajoled until I told
him the only way to prevent shock to his parents
was to notify them that he was safe. He
grasped the situation and smiled happily as he
gave his name and started for the ambulance.</p>

<p>Ah, Jimmy Kerwin, you are a thoroughbred,
if ever there was one.</p>

<p>But why recall all the details of that frightful
disaster—the most awful experience I have
ever met with. Have I not told enough to justify
the indignation that filled me when I saw the
Death’s head and read those heartless legends?</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The new Music Hall opened last evening
as per schedule. I was not surprised to read
in the papers this morning that the opening
night was a brilliant success. Every seat was
sold. The audience was as enthusiastic as it
was large. This was well—a smaller audience
would not have been a fitting crown to Chicago’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
shame and humanity’s disgrace. Humanity
has glossed itself over with a veneer of what it
pleases to term civilization, but primitive man
peeps out from beneath its edges and obtrudes
itself whenever and wherever the veneer is
cracked ever so little. And so, a large audience
was to have been expected. The managers
of the place well knew human nature.</p>

<p>The applause of that audience was the apotheosis
of poor old Rip Van Winkle’s lament,
“How soon we are forgot.” Things inanimate
revolted at the sight and sound of it. A drop
curtain caught, precisely as that cheap, flimsy
asbestos fraud did on that memorable day at
the Iroquois. And then the insensate human
things remembered—remembered that they were
not fire proof. They remembered, not the
dead, but that other caught curtain, the flame,
the gas, the trampling, crushing, tearing rush
of madmen fighting for life, and the farcical exits.
They remembered themselves only, and were
startled, affrighted, ripe for a panic for a moment,
and then—they laughed again!</p>

<p>Human beings seeking gay diversion in a
crypt of death, splitting the air of a charnel
house with vociferous applause, startling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
ghosts that people the place by boisterous
laughter—faugh!</p>

<p>The performance over, the callous ones filed
slowly out of the hall, chatting like magpies
and discussing the merits of the various features
of the performance. They traversed the same
road over which the ghastly forms of that other
audience were carried. And as the pleasure
seekers gaily tripped along, they passed between
and over scores and scores of recumbent ghosts.
Had the forms of these poor wraiths been more
substantial there would have been brushings
against them, stumblings over them.</p>

<p>Over the door the Death’s head still grinned.
Chicago’s shame was complete. Her burnt
offerings on the altar of Mammon were forgotten.</p>

<div class="chapter"><div class="transnote">
<h2 id="Transcribers_Notes" class="nobreak p1">Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
